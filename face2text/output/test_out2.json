They want their soul patch back By Patrick Huguenin February 16, 2017 Getty Images Every decade has its style, whether it\u2019s top hats and monocles or parachute pants and Airwalks. Facial hair is no different. Every mutton chop, soul patch, and handlebar mustache belongs to its own special time\u2014and just because these guys belong in the modern decade doesn\u2019t mean their beards do. Here are 13 modern men with decade-specific facial fuzz. Where does yours belong?

In fact, Abe Lincoln was the first bearded president. With him came the \u201cchin curtain,\u201d a beard that starts just above your jaw line and goes straight down. Abe made his extra chin-y by wearing it without a mustache, and to be perfectly honest, no one has pulled it off since. 1870: Sensational Sideburns 2/13 Getty Images 1870: Sensational Sideburns The face-flanking beasts known as sideburns didn\u2019t get their name until the spectacularly scruffy Civil War general Ambrose Burnside rose to fame. His cottony white cheek fluff grew to magnificent length and connected over his lip, leaving his chin bare. It\u2019s a look that makes a man look like a zany inventor\u2014or a meme. 1880/90: The Full Bush 3/13 Getty Images 1880/90: The Full Bush Thanks to history's two hairiest presidents\u2014Rutherford Hayes and, briefly, James Garfield\u2014the last part of the century was a beard-growin' free-for-all. In this bushy period, long before the invention of the electric clipper, facial hair was allowed to be free. There is a strong possibility that your facial hair right now is nostalgic for this era. 1900/10: The Handlebar Mustache 4/13 Getty Images 1900/10: The Handlebar Mustache Contrary to hipster belief, the handlebar mustache was invented at the turn of the century\u2014not in an artist\u2019s Williamsburg garage circa 2009. President Taft brought the art of tip-twirling to the White House, where it left such an impression that another mustache hasn\u2019t inhabited the Oval Office since. 1920: The Distinguished Uncle 5/13 Getty Images 1920: The Distinguished Uncle While the young gents of the roaring \u201820s were ducking in and out of speakeasies, full beards made a comeback on a distinguished set of older gents. Think snowy-haired industrialists and railroad tycoons. Or Harrison Ford in one of his don\u2019t-be-fooled-by-the-gray-I-can-still-knock-you-out phases. 1930: Dainty Mustaches 6/13 Getty Images 1930: Dainty Mustaches First there was the Charlie Chaplin mustache\u2014also known as the \u201ctoothbrush mustache\u201d because it was about the size and shape of a toothbrush. Let\u2019s not talk about that one. It went out of fashion hard. Then came the \u201cpencil mustache,\u201d popularized by Clark Gable. This thin strip across the upper lip stays out of the way of the nose, and looks down upon heavier mustaches. 1940/50: Birth of the Goatee 7/13 Getty Images 1940/50: Birth of the Goatee Dizzy Gillespie brought in the soul patch, and the Beatnik movement birthed the goatee. The early look was neat and thin\u2014think of it as a natural outgrowth of the pencil mustache. An outgrowth that could be thoughtfully stroked in a smoky jazz club. 1960: The Goatee Grows Up 8/13 Getty Images 1960: The Goatee Grows Up Counter culture. Coffee houses. Che Guevara. It was time to let those goatees be free. Mustaches reconnected with noses. Soul patches attained the length that would eventually qualify them as \u201cflavor savors.\u201d Men let their facial hair be, well, hairy, with the concept of \u201cscruff\u201d joining the revolution. 1970: The Horseshoe Mustache 9/13 Getty Images 1970: The Horseshoe Mustache The \u201870s were a huge decade for hair in general. Guys quit going to the barber. The Bee Gees were a thing. The explosion of facial hair provided the perfect canvas for the decade\u2019s greatest invention: the horseshoe mustache. It will forever belong to Hulk Hogan, but it\u2019s available to any guy who wants to throw on a trucker hat and crush a beer in his fist. 1980: The Chevron 10/13 Getty Images 1980: The Chevron The \u201880s were a mustache cage match, and there was one winner: Tom Selleck. This paragon of manhood introduced the world to his full, luxurious, lip ornament on \u201cMagnum PI.\u201d We shudder to think of him without it. Stay strong, Tom. For you, every month is Movember. 1990: Alt Goatees 11/13 Getty Images 1990: Alt Goatees Remember those well-behaved midcentury goatees? The \u201890s made the goatee-soul-patch combo the new facial hair of alt rock. It became bold and thick. We\u2019re looking at you, Fred Durst, Kid Rock, Rob Zombie\u2014the list goes on. With the right attitude, any guy can still embrace this \u201890s vibe. 2000: Five o\u2019 Clock Shadow Plus 12/13 Getty Images 2000: Five o\u2019 Clock Shadow Plus The early aughts were all about almost growing a beard. Think Keanu Reeves and Colin Farrell with soft patches of scruff dappling their jaw lines. It was a soft look that said, \u201cNever mind my beard, girl, get lost in my eyes.\u201d It was self-assured but not hyper-masculine. Which meant another big beard\u00a0blast was imminent. 2010: Lumbersexuals 13/13 Getty Images 2010: Lumbersexuals Grow \u2018em long. Grow \u2018em strong. The \u201ctwenty-teens\u201d have been defined by the biggest beard volumes in over a century. Wild and scraggly, billowing, and unkempt, these are the beards of guys who just rode in from the frontier, and are now enjoying a chai latte at their boutique design firm. But, hey, when you can impress people with the sheer number of days it\u2019s been since you last shaved, why not keep it up another week? Or another decade.

First create the shape with a beard trimmer. A general guide is a straight line down from the corner of your mouth. It's your call if you want to connect it to your mustache or not. Shave the lower border line at the bottom of your chin bone. Then set it in stone with a wet shave. Cheeks and neck will need to be shaved on a daily basis to stop the goatee from looking like a peculiarly shaped beard. Both Brad Pitt and Idris Elba keep the goatee from looking too throwback by balancing it out with a mustache and wearing the hair relatively short \u2013 mowed every few days with the lower half of the guards on a beard trimmer.

Soul Patches The soul patch is, arguably, the most illogical of all 90's trends. The chin strap beard, while stupid, clearly said, \"I do too have a chin. I outlined it in my face hair. See?\" The goatee wordlessly declared, \"I'm an assh*le!\" So what did a soul patch say? \"The only thing I follow more religiously than minor league baseball is trends involving confused displays of masculinity.\" If you ever had a soul patch, please take a moment to stew in your shame. If you still have a soul patch, you've got a little barbecue sauce in there. 2. JNCOs Perhaps it was because of all of the Skip-It related chafing wounds, or just a general fondness for the feel of perpetually filthy shreds of fabric flopping against your calves, but, in the 90's, nothing was cooler than going to Kohl's with your mom to buy a fly new pair of JNCOs. WAS, being the operative word. We can all agree now that the circumference of your \"pipes\" should not exceed the length of your inseam. It just looks stupid. It doesn't matter how many yo-yo's you had stashed in there; no one needs that much room in their pants. 3. Leather Pants No one who was over the age of 11 at any point in the 90's made it through the decade without wondering, \"Could I pull off leather pants?\" The answer, ubiquitously, was, \"No,\" but Ricky Martin, Crazy Spice, and the actresses on Charmed were unrelenting in their desire to make leather pants last. In the end, the insane dry cleaning bills and the fact that you can't take anyone in leather pants seriously defeated this terrible trend. Just in case: no. You can't pull off leather pants. Don't try to bring them back. No. 4. Thug Looney Tunes Shirts Nothing proves the collective idiocy of the 90's more than the fact that a group of businessmen thought, \"People will probably buy T-shirts with Looney Tunes characters dressed in 'urban' attire,\" and then people actually bought them. This fad predated the safety mechanism of ironic fashion. If you wore an oversized T-shirt with a picture of Bugs Bunny wearing baggy, backwards jeans, you genuinely thought it was cool. At some point in the 90's, at least one person was probably held at gun point by someone in a gangster Tasmanian Devil T-shirt. Just think about that and vow to never let this fashion trend return. 5. Backwards Jeans Why was Bugs Bunny dressed in backwards jeans? Oh yeah. Because that was a thing people did. Specifically \"Mac Daddy\" and \"Daddy Mac\" of the hip-hop group Kris Kross. They are to blame for countless misplaced beepers and chaos at junior high urinals. This is the kind of trend that can only be discussed by using the phrase \"youth culture\" in the most crotchety tone of distanced disparagement, but, come on, you tried your jeans on backwards. Just don't try it again. Page 1 of 5Next Filed Under: soul patch90sLists Comments We like you. Do you like us too? Don't ask me again.

Maybe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not releasing any new material so watching them now promises to be only marginally more exciting than checking in with Kurt Cobain. \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0Or maybe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because their return was so unexpected, it's left me reeling with uncertainty.\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, what else from the 90's will return? Here are five fearless predictions: Advertisement 1. Lilith Fair Back in the mid 90\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bunch of ladies saw the success of Lollapalooza and decided to show the world that sisters could do it for themselves.\u00c2\u00a0 Soon a group of somewhat talented artists banded together united only by their one hit wonder status and lack of a penis.\u00c2\u00a0 Shawn Colvin, Meredith Brooks, Paula Cole, and others.\u00c2\u00a0 (I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d include Sarah McLachlan, but she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s had more than one hit and that would ruin my wild generalization.\u00c2\u00a0 Also, she never replied after I wrote that letter about kissing her so hard, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just going to assume she actually does have \u00c2\u00a0a penis.) Well in 2010, Lillith Fair will return with a vengeance.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 And not with Lady Gaga and Ke$ha flying the grrl-power banner. \u00c2\u00a0No, instead, our old friends will take to the stage with new anthems like Brooks\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a Bitch (Just Like This Menopause);\u00c2\u00a0 Colvin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cSonny Never Visits Anymore;\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 and Paula Cole\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cPiss Off Gladstone, I Had Two Hits.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The feisty music-loving college girls of the 90s will now be able to purchase tickets at Starbucks, Talbots, and, of course, Gymboree. 2. Bad Sex I hesitate to go here because after the Lillith Fair cracks I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d hate to be misunderstood as a misogynist.\u00c2\u00a0 But being misunderstood is what writing for the internet is all about.\u00c2\u00a0 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like a big game of \u00e2\u0080\u009cTelephone\u00e2\u0080\u009d that you play only with your deaf friends.\u00c2\u00a0 Who are also neurologically impaired. \u00c2\u00a0So here goes.\u00c2\u00a0 I know it may come as a surprise to you 21st century boys and girls, but women were different in the 90\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\u00c2\u00a0 This was before Sex and the City feminism took hold. Today, women hold onto the false delusion that they can empower themselves by tweeting \u00c2\u00a0frankly about how much they enjoy \u00c2\u00a0oral sex.\u00c2\u00a0 Where a frattish mentality of getting drunk and laid is somehow akin to saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a woman and I will not be denied !\u00e2\u0080\u009d Now, of course that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wrong-headed and false, but men don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t typically try to dispel that notion because, well why would we dissuade you from talking about oral sex?\u00c2\u00a0 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s much easier for dudes to say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re an independent woman. Now finish your beer and do that thing I like with the thing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But back in the 90\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, it was a different scene.\u00c2\u00a0 Intelligent, sexual women across the land (or at least at my University) wanted to run with the wolves while reading Naomi Wolfe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Beauty Myth.\u00c2\u00a0 They couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t put on make up or shave their legs without asking, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy am I doing this; are these the tools of my oppression; and how does Gladstone get so dreamy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the stats to prove this, but in the 90\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fewer asses got spanked during sex then any decade in modern history.\u00c2\u00a0 The 69 rose in prominence as the only accepted egalitarian form of oral sex. And for the first time in history, a frank dialogue about the magic and glory of the menses was considered foreplay. Well, get ready, because in 2010, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all coming back.\u00c2 \u2193 Continue Reading Below Sex and the City 2 will hit theaters and suddenly women will react in horror at the lifeless shell Carrie Bradshaw has become.\u00c2\u00a0 Soon Ani DiFranco records will start to sell again and French maid outfits will be returned in record numbers.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Your free ride is over fellas. Time to grow a pony tail and get some Indigo Girls records. 3. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThanks for Sharing\u00e2\u0080\u009d/\u00e2\u0080\u009dToo Much Information\u00e2\u0080\u009d Historians tell us that for a brief six week period in the fall of 1991, it was actually considered somewhat witty and/or clever to say \u00e2\u0080\u009cthanks for sharing\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009ctoo much information\u00e2\u0080\u009d when confronted with unwanted details from another\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal life.\u00c2\u00a0 We may never know why humor was ascribed to these phrases, but all our best data tells us it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true.\u00c2\u00a0 Indeed, even today, there are still clusters of humorless conversation trolls who feel empowered by using \u00c2\u00a0these phrases as if they were magical incantations, instantly transforming \u00c2\u00a0the speaker into a person more important than the addressee.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 They have no idea that every self-respecting human stopped saying this shortly before the start of the Clinton administration. Well they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in luck.\u00c2\u00a0 In 2010, a void will form in our language and welcome the unfortunate return of these phrases.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0Why?\u00c2\u00a0 Because in 2010 \u00e2\u0080\u009cFail\u00e2\u0080\u009d will finally leave the vernacular.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 (Incidentally, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmeh\u00e2\u0080\u009d will hold tight for another five years.) Soon, millions of the worst people in the world will be unsure what to say when being exposed to unexpected, unwanted information.\u00c2\u00a0 And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s when the TMI jargon returns. Some of you may be doubting this prediction.\u00c2\u00a0 How does it make sense to reply \u00e2\u0080\u009cthanks for sharing\u00e2\u0080\u009d to a youtube video you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t approve of? \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0Well , in truth, it makes no sense.\u00c2\u00a0 But then again, it was never really logical to say \u00e2\u0080\u009ctoo much information\u00e2\u0080\u009d to your co-worker when he was trying to open up to you about the death of his mother either. 4. Goatees Did you misread that? Not Goatse. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a 21st century creation.\u00c2\u00a0 No, I said \u00e2\u0080\u009cgoatee\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that tiny beard circling one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mouth that --much like Goatse-- \u00c2\u00a0actually does conjure thoughts of a-holes.\u00c2\u00a0 But in the 90\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it was part of the standard uniform.\u00c2\u00a0 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to believe, but just over a decade ago, this incomplete facial hair formation, could actually increase a guy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chances of having sex \u00e2\u0080\u0093 especially when coupled with long hair.\u00c2\u00a0 It was a look that said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey world, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a beard. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not clean-shaven either.\u00c2\u00a0 You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t define me with your boring rules. \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00c2\u00a0 And seriously what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sexier than that? In 2010, the goatee comes back stronger than ever. Why? Because of this column.\u00c2\u00a0 The power of the internet, baby.\u00c2\u00a0 Tomorrow morning, every guy who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s read this will stare in his bathroom mirror overcome by a certain sensation.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood lord, Gladstone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s onto something!\u00c2\u00a0 What if the ladies couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see the skin immediately around my mouth?\u00c2\u00a0 What if it appeared from the proper distance that I had a cinnamon donut stuck to my face?\u00c2\u00a0 Good lord, how much tail would that get me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 You may doubt it now, but it's already in play.\u00c2\u00a0 You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re already on your way. Congratulations, sexy! In fact, I just started a facebook group called \u00e2\u0080\u009cGoatees for 2010\u00e2\u0080\u009d to get this baby going.\u00c2\u00a0 If the group gets, over 100 members with pics posted, I promise to post too. (I understand it will take a few days to get the facial hair in place).\u00c2\u00a0 I will also do my best to get the other Cracked columnists to do so \u00e2\u0080\u0093 understanding, of course that Daniel O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Brien and Michael Swaim may lack the testerone-based fortitude to achieve such things. 5. Full House Hey remember one of the worst sitcoms ever? No? Why? Because you were 5? Oh.\u00c2\u00a0 Well what about syndication? Yes, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m talking about Full House. That show about a Jewish guy who was somehow named Tanner and not actually Jewish who had to raise two baby troll dolls after his wife died. Thinking fast, he recruits John Stamos and Dave Coulier to help out.\u00c2\u00a0 The show ran from 1987 to 1995 and I imagine it sucked the entire length of that time, but truth be told, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure I ever saw a full episode. In any event, in 2010, Full House returns.\u00c2\u00a0 Not a remake.\u00c2\u00a0 All the same actors return in modern day.\u00c2\u00a0 The make-shift family will reunite to help the Olson twins deal with their eating disorders.\u00c2\u00a0 Bob Saget, once known for being funny and one of the dirtiest stand ups prior to Full House, will now drop F bombs non stop.\u00c2\u00a0 And Dave Coulier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s catch phrase will be \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey, y\u00e2\u0080\u0099know Alanis Morrissette was totally talking about going down on me in that theater.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe me?\u00c2\u00a0 Doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sound right for TV? What if I told you the cast did the whole show in black face and it was called Tyler Perry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Full House of Payne?\u00c2\u00a0 Yep. Believe it.\u00c2\u00a0 Enjoy your 2010, guys.

We are Living in the Golden Age of the Goatee by Dan Nosowitz January 06, 2016 Email This Article From To Please separate multiple addresses with commas. We won't share addresses with third parties. Subscribe me to the Atlas Obscura Newsletter A triple portrait\u00a0of Charles I by painter Anthony Van Dyck. Both men helped popularize the goatee in the 17th century. (Photo:\u00a0Public Domain/WikiCommons) This year\u2019s Golden State Warriors basketball team is an extraordinary bunch, shattering records left and right\u2014and yet, there\u2019s something deeply strange about them. The bulk of the team has either currently has or recently had the same facial hair as Guy Fieri, your least favorite uncle, or Edward Norton during most of the \u201990s. Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Harrison Barnes, Andre Iguodala, Brandon Rush, Shaun Livingston, and many other members of the defending NBA championship team have at various times sported a goatee, but in contrast to Mr. Fieri, can also be easily described as stylish and fashionable young men. For many, the goatee is a symbol of \u201890s rebellion that\u2019s faded into a classic Midwestern Dad look, a comfortably uncool style of facial hair. But while facial hair styles wax and wane over the years and decades and centuries, facial hair experts agree: We\u2019re in a pretty strange time for men\u2019s facial hair, one not quite like any time in history. To look at the history of the goatee we have to first decide what a goatee actually is. \u201cWell, there\u2019s no official arbiter of all knowledge on this matter,\u201d laughed Christopher Oldstone-Moore, an academic at Wright State University who studies masculinity and especially beards. (He\u2019s also the author of Of Beards and Men: The Revealing History of Facial Hair.) Oldstone-Moore says that the goatee is a partial beard, meaning parts of the face are clean-shaven and parts are not, and that it must always include the chin. Variations from there abound; the connected, trimmed circle of hair around the mouth is most often called a \u201cfull goatee\u201d or just \u201cgoatee,\u201d though the University of Toronto\u2019s Allan Peterkin, author of One Thousand Beards: A Cultural History of Facial Hair, refers to this as a \u201ccircle beard.\u201d Steph Curry of the Golden State Warriors. (Photo:\u00a0Keith Allison/flickr) If the mustache and chin-beard are not connected, this can sometimes be called a goatee, but is more often defined more precisely based on its length and styling. Sometimes it\u2019s a \u201cVan Dyke,\u201d but if allowed to grow longer and pointier, it\u2019s known as an \u201cimperial.\u201d The history of the goatee is curious and often erroneous. The name certainly comes from the peculiar long fur underneath the chin of a billy goat. As a result of that, the half-man, half-goat Greek god Pan is usually depicted as having a goatee of some sort. Pan was the god of shepherds, but also was a symbol of wildness. And in turn, as imagery from the Greeks (and elsewhere) was subsumed into Christianity, depictions of Satan often included goat-like, or Pan-like, features: of course the enemy of Christianity would be the primitive, pagan, wild god of the Greeks. But this, thinks Oldstone-Moore, was pretty much coincidental. \u201cYou almost never see ancient people wearing what we think of as a goatee,\u201d he says. \u201cI think of the goatee as a modern beard. I don\u2019t think it has a very ancient history at all.\u201d The ancient Egyptians did sometimes wear a false beard, often metallic, known as a postiche, but the line between jewelry and beard is kind of fuzzy there; Egyptians did not usually grow a beard in the shape of the postiche. The goatee really caught on in the 17th century thanks to a Flemish painter named Anthony van Dyck. Van Dyck was a hugely successful portrait painter who completed paintings of various dukes and queens and princesses and, notably, Charles I. But he also painted many self-portraits, and van Dyck wore a trim partial beard: a small pointed chin-beard and a delicately curved mustache. Charles I wore this style of beard as well, and paintings of both van Dyck and Charles circulated throughout Europe. The beard style of these two men became enormously popular, and was eventually named after the painter, with a slight mutation in spelling to Van Dyke. \u201cThough it was popular in Europe in the 17th century, in the form of the Van Dyke, goatees and all other facial hair practically disappeared in polite circles in the 18th and early 19th century,\u201d says Sean Trainor, who\u2019s written about the history of facial hair for the Atlantic. Soon enough, it began popping up in less polite circles, and the beard style became associated with soldiers, appearing on the Three Musketeers and Napoleon Bonaparte, and on through to the American Wild West, where it was worn by General Custer and Buffalo Bill. \u201cThe goatee has some kind of connection with someone who is a very forceful, assertive person,\u201d says Oldstone-Moore. The God Pan, frequently depicted with a goatee. (Photo: Public Domain/WikiCommons) But facial hair trends come in waves, and those waves became shorter and shorter as globalization sped up communications in the 20th century. By the early to mid-1900s, beard styles were rotating out almost by decade: the 1920s and 1930s in the U.S. were primarily beardless, but small beards, including some we\u2019d recognize as goatees, were fashionable among the Beats and jazz musicians in the 1940s. In the 1950s, clean-shaven was the only way to go, but by the 1960s, full beards were in\u2014a sign of rebellion against the square decade that came before. That backed off in the 1970s, when the most popular facial hair style was the mustache, but bounced back in the 1980s, when stubble, at most, was popular. In the 1990s is where things get more complicated. As a fashion era, that decade was about excess: Swarovski crystals, giant baggy clothes, huge retail chains, more, more, more. And yet the beard style was relatively modest: a trim goatee or soul patch. Oldstone-Moore thinks this is because facial hair moves in short waves, from full to partial beards to no beards and back again\u2014he thinks it\u2019s unlikely that a trend would move from clean-shaven to a full beard. Peterkin agrees; specific facial hair styles, he says, don\u2019t necessarily have any consistent meaning to them. Sporting a goatee in the 1940s made a plenty big enough statement just because sporting any facial hair at all firmly set the wearer against the clean-shaven era just past. W.F \u201cBuffalo Bill\u201d Cody, in 1875. (Photo: Public Domain/WikiCommons) But now, a more rebellious beard would be what Peterkin calls a \u201cmountain man\u201d beard, because the previous era, the 1990s, wasn\u2019t clean shaven. These days, the goatee is the status quo, the safe bet, the mainstream look. \u201cNeither conservatively clean-shaved nor radically shaggy, the goatee speaks to the consensus-minded 90s, not to our own moment of extremes,\u201d says Trainor. To place yourself as a something outside the mainstream, you have to go more extreme, a giant beard or rougher beard of some sort. (Going clean shaven is not usually a good way to protest; there are always enough clean-shaven men that going clean-shaven never makes much of a statement.) \u201cWhen I hear the word goatee, the first people that spring to mind are pot-bellied MLB pitchers, aging country music singers, C-list celebrities like Larry the Cable Guy and Guy Fieri, and suburban cops,\u201d says Trainor. But there are other ways to understand the cultural meaning of facial hair. \u201cThe racial line is quite striking in every respect when it comes to facial hair,\u201d says Oldstone-Moore. Beard styles among black men do not follow in really any way the patterns of beard styles among white men. The mustache, for example, is a particularly fraught facial hair style among white men, with infrequent periods of fashionability and recurrences as a mocking or joking one all other times. Not so among black men: \u201cAfrican-American men have always worn the mustache, and not as a trend,\u201d says Peterkin. A publicity still from the 1921 film, The Three Musketeers. (Photo: Public Domain/WikiCommons) According to these beard experts, the goatee exists in a different state of fashionability amongst black men compared with white men. Although despite the heavily goateed Golden State Warriors, Trainor thinks the goatee is on the wane as well\u2014just not quite as far down as it is among white men. \u201cBut, even among black men, I think the goatee is a fading fashion \u2013 with the beards of everyone from Drake, Common, and Lebron James to Willard Scott and Rick Ross filling the cultural space that was once occupied by the goatee,\u201d he says. I\u2019m not so sure the goatee is exactly on the wane, but certainly it\u2019s true that the goatee is barely seen as a beard in the NBA. On lists of the NBA\u2019s best beards, it\u2019s rare to find more than one or two goatees, even spectacular ones like DeAndre Jordan\u2019s. There is yet another element to the goatee that gives it perennial popularity: it\u2019s very easy to grow. For men in their late teens or early 20s whose beards are not that full yet, the goatee is much more popular, because the hair on the upper lip and the chin comes in more densely than in any other part of the face. It\u2019s not just age that can make growing full beards difficult: \u201cDifferent ethnic groups have different capacities to grow facial hair,\u201d says Peterkin. \u201cLike American Indians for example often can\u2019t grow full beards. And for black men there\u2019s often issues with ingrown hairs and so forth while trying to grow beards.\u201d African-American hair tends to be a bit curlier than the hair of those with primarily European descent, which often leads to a patchier or more difficult-to-grow beard; curly hairs can irritate the delicate skin of the face. A goatee might be the only option\u2014but that doesn\u2019t mean men of all races won\u2019t try all sorts of beards. Goatee-wearer Guy Fieri. (Photo: Kelly Huston/flickr) This all ties in with one trend that connects facial hair of all men. \u201cPreviously in history, if you had a beard, you would keep it for life, it was part of who you were,\u201d says Peterkin. \u201cBut now people go back and forth.\u201d Steph Curry, for example, has been clean-shaven, has had a full beard, has had a connected goatee, has had only a chin-beard, and has had a disconnected goatee, all within the past few years. With rare exceptions like James Harden, the beard is not necessarily a fundamental part of a man\u2019s identity anymore; it\u2019s a fun thing to play with, that you can change with the seasons or just however you feel. And some days, you just feel like a postiche. Enjoying This Story? Get our latest, delivered straight to your inbox by subscribing to our newsletter.

                            "text": "Here Are the Most Popular Beard Styles Over the Past 16 Decades Beards seem to be having a moment.But really, they've been having one for years.The rise of the \"Postmillennial He-Man Beard Epoch\" has been with us for some time, with one\u00a0New York Times writer pegging it to around 2007, when he\u00a0noticed\u00a0his middle-aged beard seemed suddenly trendy with the younger men around him. Fast forward a few years\u00a0and the\u00a0\"lumbersexual\" revolution\u00a0hit hard, with beards paired with plaid shirts for a \"Ron Swanson mixed with Ryan Gosling\" look. Now, gone are the plaid shirts \u2014 2015 is about the\u00a0beard-and-man-bun combo.The recent facial hair enthusiasm might give the impression young men have just discovered beards. But facial hair isn't a modern novelty \u2014\u00a0there's always the question of how to shape what we've got. Trends cycle in and out, as any photo of a\u00a0Civil War general\u00a0will remind you. The latter half of the 1800s was a beard bonanza, while in the 1920s, beards became rarer and rarer (thanks, in no small part, to the introduction of\u00a0commercialized shaving razors\u00a0by Gillette).\u00a0By the 1950s, the number of men with beards was at an\u00a0all-time low, only to be revived by hippie culture in the late 1960s and 1970s. By then, businessmen were\u00a0growing beards\u00a0\u2014 as evidenced by the\u00a0facial hair evolution\u00a0on\u00a0Mad Men \u2014\u00a0only to morph into those regrettable goatees of the late '90s-early aughts.Check out the photos to see how far our faces have come.Beards had a serious \"moment\" from the 1850s to 1880s.The early 1850s was a time of restrained elegance and style; by the 1880s, beards were everywhere. A beard signaled masculinity and health, and there were endless varieties. Some beards precariously off the bottom of men's faces, while some came with mustaches (something Gen.\u00a0Ulysses S. Grant and\u00a0Gen.\u00a0Stonewall Jackson could both agree upon).\u00a0By the 1920s and 1930s, old men owned the bearded look.Think about it: Gatsby didn't have a beard. In the 1920s and 1930s, beards were no longer counted among trendy facial hair. By the looks of archival photos, mostly men of a certain age wore beards.In the 1940 and '50s, facial hair was rare. Unless, of course, you had a goatee.\u00a0Facial hair was still a pretty uncommon during that time, but the goatee made its way into popular culture by way of counterculture movements like the beatniks and influential jazz musicians in the '40s (including Dizzy\u00a0Gillespie, one of the only men who made a soul patch look good).By the 1960s, beards were a symbol of creativity and rebelliousness.A clean-shaven look was still popular in the early 1960s (again, see the early seasons of Mad Men). There were, however, some beard trends, like the goatee and scruffy beard. But judging by archival photos, they were worn mostly by creative types like writers, filmmakers and revolutionaries like Che Guevara. Definitely not a style for the office.With the rise of hippie culture and disco in the '70s, full beards made a comeback.In the 1970s facial hair and men's grooming were more varied than before. Hairstyling wasn't just for women and men generally embraced a more hairy look overall. The influence of bands like the Beatles and Bee Gees also can't be ignored. Overgrown beards were in style but mustaches reigned supreme.The rise of '90s alternative bands brought with it goatees and soul patches.Men embraced a clean-shaven look in the decade after the '70s, thanks in part to the rise of corporate culture and political conservatism. There were certainly the occasional and iconic mustaches\u00a0(think: Tom Selleck in Magnum P.I.) but a full-on beard wasn't in style\u00a0in the workplace, forcing many to adopt baby smooth skin.That all began changing in the early '90s when popular alternative bands became more mainstream. Musicians in bands like Nirvana, Anthrax and Everclear wore a range of facial hairstyles ranging from the soul patch to dyed beards.\u00a0In the early 2000s, things got a little scruffy and patchy.After the soul patch of the '90s, a hybrid of the goatee and scruffy beard look became more popular. Celebrities like Keanu Reeves, Matt LeBlanc and Colin Farrell grew beards that evoked a nonchalant attitude. The extra-shaggy goatee remained popular also\u00a0thanks in part\u00a0to stars like Brad Pitt and Johnny Depp.Thankfully, we've achieved bearded perfection: the man bun-and-beard combo.* praise hands *"

Even in the heat of the summer, the hairy trend continues to prevail. Still, if you think that\u2019s crazy, you probably missed the \u201990s. From about 1990-1998, some very weird facial hairstyles dominated the music world. There were a lot of incomplete goatees and quite a few runaway beards. Don\u2019t believe us? Check out some of the craziest and most \u201990s facial hair below\u2013 but we\u2019re warning you, you can never un-see what you\u2019re about to witness. 1 The Floating Goatee Getty Images A goatee is just a small patch of hair located on the chin. Seemingly simple, yet in the \u201990s, a lot of musicians literally missed the mark. John Dolmayan style was the perfect example of this nonchalant look, he had a soul patch just above his chin, so it wasn\u2019t quite a goatee, but it can\u2019t be disregarded all together. Hence, a new category is born: \u201cthe floater.\u201d 2 The Chin Mane Getty Images This exaggerated style still lives on today\u2013 ahem, Brad Pitt\u2013 but it was all the rage for rockers back in the day. Anthrax\u2019s lead guitarist Scott Ian not only sported this look, but he often dyed his mane. We\u2019re guessing to match his mood. 3 The Braided Beard Getty Images Shavo Odadjian clearly takes the cake when it comes to braided beards. The man had facial hair longer than the hair on most people\u2019s head. It wasn\u2019t a good luck, but it was very \u201990s. 4 The Landing Strip @artalexakis This style is pretty self-explanatory. It\u2019s a thin strip of hair that starts under the lip and ends wherever it wants. Please look to Art Alexakis for reference. The dad of three still rocks his classic style although no one else has since 1998. 5 Animal Style Sideburns Getty Images Sideburns alone aren\u2019t a \u201990s trend, but grooming those bad boys to your jawline? That\u2019s something that most men avoid these days. Back in his Limp Bizkit prime, Wes Borland sported some of the creepiest sideburns we\u2019ve ever seen. (Seriously, if his appearance in the \u201cNookie\u201d video doesn\u2019t haunt you, we don\u2019t know what will.) 6 The Hourglass Conundrum Getty Images Fred Durst rocked this style loud and proud in the \u201990s. His thin and oddly shaped beard closely resembled an hourglass. 7 The Dot Getty Images This style is similar to the \u201cfloating goatee\u201d with considerably less effort. As the name suggests, it is a literal dash of hair under your lip. Not very logical, but it was a trend all the same. 8 The 3-piece Masterpiece: A Combination Style [image src=\"wp-attachment://46414\"] Although this style combines three already horrible looks on the list, it has to stand on it\u2019s own for all of the musicians who rocked this exact look. Late Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain wore it best. Not only did Kurt\u2019s mustache connect to his beard, but he took it a step further by having a thin, two-part goatee that wasn\u2019t connected to anything.

Bryan Curtis on the beard for all seasons. Plus, a gallery of A-list whiskers. Bryan Curtis 11.12.09 6:13 PM ET Breaking: Brad Pitt has a full-blown goatee. It\u2019s long and gray and bushy, and when Pitt showed it off last week at a movie premiere, it was beaded in a style favored by the pirates of the Caribbean. If there were ever a time to reassess the state of facial hair, this would seem to be it. It used to be that growing a goatee was some kind of fashion statement. Now the goatee has become the Gap T-shirt of beards. The New New Goatee can be worn at home or at the office, by the hip and unhip alike, signifying, well, just about anything. Click Image to View Our Gallery of Goatees The New New Goatee is a beard for all seasons, as harmless as a tattoo. This becomes apparent by reviewing a list of Americans who have been sporting goatees lately: Kobe Bryant, Tim McGraw, Pastor Rick Warren, chef Rick Bayless, NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd, Todd Palin, Larry the Cable Guy, even Mariah Carey in her latest music video. \u201cThere is no kinship at all,\u201d Chuck Todd, who is a good sport for answering his phone, tells me. Larry the Cable Guy does not concur: \u201cI think Brad Pitt might have the goatee just because I pulled it off so good,\u201d he says. What does a New New Goatee mean? First you have to understand that the goatee has always been hard to pin down. Shakespeare had one, as did the Flemish painter Anthony van Dyck, whom the Van Dyke was named after. (For simplicity\u2019s sake, I have grouped the Van Dyke and the goatee together, even though the Van Dyke is the official name for the lip-chin combo.) \u201cImagery often shows Pan or the Devil with a goatee,\u201d says Allan Peterkin, the author of One Thousand Beards: A Cultural History of Facial Hair. In the 20th century, the goatee was alluring enough to attract Lenin and Buffalo Bill, Burl Ives and Dizzy Gillespie, Colonel Sanders and Malcolm X, Dobie Gillis\u2019 Maynard G. Krebs and Spike Lee, Anthrax\u2019s Scott Ian and Kurt Cobain. It was Cobain and his grunge mates who resurrected the goatee from its Beat obsolescence in the 1990s. Though the goatee retains little of their residue of cool\u2014if you\u2019re at the cutting edge of facial hair, you\u2019re wearing a full Zach Galifianakis\u2014it is oddly more prominent in mainstream American life than ever. The New New Goatee sometimes symbolizes brainy gravitas. This is most notable in Chuck Todd, NBC\u2019s chief White House correspondent. Todd\u2019s ginger goatee, which he grew in the summer of 2002, is a bracing counterpoint to clean-shaven mugs like Brian Williams\u2019. \u201cIt highlights that nobody on TV has facial hair,\u201d Todd says. But those carefully trimmed whiskers are part of Todd\u2019s magic. A veteran of the D.C. insider tip sheet The Hotline, Todd is NBC\u2019s numbers guy, its Election Day stats guru. In the blowhard universe of TV news, Todd\u2019s pronouncements seem to carry real weight\u2014you actually believe he knows what he\u2019s talking about. Todd\u2019s goatee confers upon him the same kind of authority as a political-science professor\u2019s goatee. Last month, when Todd lost a public bet with ABC News correspondent Jake Tapper and appeared poised to shave off the goatee, blogger Dan Amira compared it to Samson\u2019s locks. Todd made a $2,000 donation to charity and kept the goatee by a whisker. Another take on the New New Goatee: It is a symbol of bloggy, stay-at-home cred. \u201cI wish I were part of some grand sociological trend,\u201d says Jonah Goldberg, the goateed conservative pundit and frequent blogger on National Review Online. \u201cBut I mostly do it because I work from home and it makes it easier to go very long periods of time without shaving.\u201d The New New Goatee can signify both youth and maturity. Billy Joel\u2019s goatee is a sign of an older man trying to recapture his youth. Michael Phelps\u2019 goatee is a sign of a golden boy trying to look older. There are, of course, aesthetic considerations. \u201cFirst and foremost, they\u2019re thinning,\u201d says Larry the Cable Guy. When he debuted as a morning radio personality in the 1990s, Larry\u2019s act was delightfully offensive but his face was baby-smooth. \u201cI looked like a kid, a punk, no facial hair, nothing,\u201d he says. Larry grew a full beard, but that was a smidge too country\u2014\u201cI looked like an Oak Ridge Boy\u201d\u2014so he pruned it down into a goatee. Paired with a baseball cap and sleeveless shirt, these days Larry looks like he has just exited a Golden Corral buffet. He has redneck gravitas. Don\u2019t like your New New Goatee? Simply change an accessory or two. Add some pricey eyewear, and a goatee can make you hip, as it does Johnny Depp. Doff your shirt, and it can make you all-powerful, as it does Shane Carwin of the Ultimate Fighting Championship. Stand in the vicinity of a Republican presidential candidate, and a goatee can make you look like the campaign\u2019s sage, as with McCain aide Mark Salter. A goatee can lend an otherwise unremarkable creature a touch of menace. Google News turns up dozens of criminal suspects like this one from Oregon over the weekend: \u201ca white male about 5 feet 9 inches or 6 feet tall and weighing between 160 and 180 pounds. He may have a goatee.\u201d Ooga-boogah! How did we end up with all this chin foliage? On the one hand, the New New Goatee is the case of something hip becoming something mainstream. It is also the case of the American office becoming a more casual place; Allan Peterkin notes that about the only people who can\u2019t have goatees nowadays are politicians and bankers. The New New Goatee is also a sign of our neo-Bohemia, where formal culture has mixed with hipster culture and created a mix of the two: the Wall Street trader who wears a goatee with his Michael Kors suit. Pitt reportedly grew his goatee for his role in The Lost City of Z, a real-life Victorian adventure. But what you make of the facial growth depends on what you make of Pitt. Some cast it as a youthful star finally confronting middle age (\u201cMeet Joe Grey,\u201d quipped The Daily Mail). Others have suggested he grew it just because he knew he would still look great. When Pitt attempted an earlier version of the look in January, there was at least one howl of outrage from a female fan at the Golden Globes, who was apparently convinced Pitt was hiding his magnificent face.

First create the shape with a beard trimmer. A general guide is a straight line down from the corner of your mouth. It's your call if you want to connect it to your mustache or not. Shave the lower border line at the bottom of your chin bone. Then set it in stone with a wet shave. Cheeks and neck will need to be shaved on a daily basis to stop the goatee from looking like a peculiarly shaped beard. Both Brad Pitt and Idris Elba keep the goatee from looking too throwback by balancing it out with a mustache and wearing the hair relatively short \u2013 mowed every few days with the lower half of the guards on a beard trimmer.

Why?Jennifer Aniston went full Medusa with tendrils on tendrils and a Claire's Accessories store's worth of tiny hair clips.facebook dialogPinterestPorcupine UpdosAnother way to make your updo more exciting was to make sure the ends of your hair were spiky instead of tucking them in with bobby pins. This way, they poked out in all directions and confused the eye. Claire Danes got a young Leonardo DiCaprio's attention with these broomlike bristles.facebook dialogPinterestPorcupine UpdosCourteney Cox's sprouts were the more relaxed version.facebook dialogPinterestPorcupine UpdosAlicia Silverstone combined spikes with tendrils and butterfly clips for a '90s-trend trifecta.facebook dialogPinterestBlue Eye-Shadow OverloadThe thing about wearing '90s blue eye shadow is that basically any amount is too much. (Need we remind you of the Mimi Bobeck character on The Drew Carey Show?) Here, baby Reese Witherspoon looks like she got into her mom's makeup bag and went to town.facebook dialogPinterestBlue Eye-Shadow OverloadJennifer Lopez brought her frosty blue shadow all the way up to the brow.facebook dialogPinterestBlue Eye-Shadow OverloadBack in her dark, edgy days, Angelina Jolie went for the clown-paint approach: pale skin, high arches, and a creepy Joker smile.facebook dialogPinterestSo Much Body GlitterDuring this weird blip in time, decorating yourself with glitter powders, gels, and sprays was acceptable\u2014even encouraged. And no one thought this made them look like a stripper. Britney Spears liberally applied body glitter to her d\u00e9collet\u00e9 and shoulders, creating a vaguely sweaty effect.facebook dialogPinterestCrunchy HairBefore co-washing and sulfate awareness, most hair products had the same alcohol content as Everclear. Texture was really important, whether you rocked braids, waves, or crispy curls. (Touchability, not so much.) Cameron Diaz hit the crimping iron hard for this Top Ramen hair look.facebook dialogPinterestCrunchy HairChristina Aguilera fluffed her egg-noodle curls up and out and set them with shellac.facebook dialogPinterestCrunchy HairLook at Kirsten Dunst! Her shiny zigzags are crisp and hot off the crimper.facebook dialogPinterestCrunchy HairOne way to get crimps without hot tools was to put your hair in braids before going to sleep. Looks like Kate Moss was about to do just that (after putting out her cigarette).facebook dialogPinterestCrazy Accent BraidsCoachella, shmoachella. The '90s had its own brand of boho hair, and it didn't involve wearing an oversize floral crown. Randomly placed braids were one way to signify that you were laid-back, maaaan. Madonna's take was very Sea Hag Chic: center-parted, disheveled beach waves with ropy braids.facebook dialogPinterestCrazy Accent BraidsScarlett Johansson's hair wraps were like wearing friendship bracelets in your hair.facebook dialogPinterestCrazy Accent BraidsFiona Apple decided to wear all the hair textures\u2014straight, frizzy, curly, and braided\u2014for a raised-by-wolves vibe.facebook dialogPinterestCulturally Insensitive CornrowsWe all went to the Bahamas in 1994 and collectively had the same terrible idea. Let's just pretend this never happened, OK, Juliette Lewis?facebook dialogPinterestCulturally Insensitive CornrowsYou too, Melissa Joan Hart.facebook dialogPinterestBrown LipstickNot red, not pink, but grungy brown lips were the thing. (There were so many lipsticks named after cocoa and raisins.) Women were drawn to the color because it was dark and moody, but not as try-hard as a vampy berry or goth burgundy. Mostly, it looked...muddy. T-Boz, Left-Eye, and Chilli of TLC all took time away from stapling condoms to their clothes to swipe it on.facebook dialogPinterestBrown LipstickJulianne Moore looked like she was colored in with an auburn crayon\u2014her hair, eyebrows, smoky eye shadow, and lipstick were somehow all the same shade.facebook dialogPinterestBrown LipstickJennifer Lopez gave her lips a coat of glossy wood varnish.facebook dialogPinterestBrown LipstickDrew Barrymore went totally matte. A gray-blue undertone in the color helped simulate hypothermia.facebook dialogPinterestBrown LipstickAnd then there was that frosted nude-mauve color that wasn't brown but definitely didn't look nude. It seems like Tori Spelling, Shannen Doherty, and Jennie Garth all shared the same tube of lipstick at this party, and it's the most '90s thing we've ever seen.facebook dialogPinterestTwo BarrettesCourtney Love, riot grrrls, and double-dutch jumpers had already called dibs on plastic barrettes. Then Jennifer Lopez really classed up the idea of doing your hair like an eight-year-old by adding diamonds.facebook dialogPinterestTwo BarrettesSalma Hayek wore double barrettes to a Giorgio Armani fashion show, but she looked like she was already rethinking it.facebook dialogPinterestMini BunsIt's around this time that women started wondering if wearing one bun was enough. Maybe the more, the better? Bj\u00f6rk started the trend, and everyone was charmed because she's an adorable little Icelandic pixie who wears way weirder stuff all the time.facebook dialogPinterestMini BunsGwen Stefani wore them, too, and everyone was already used to her half-shirt and bindi, so they let it slide.facebook dialogPinterestMini BunsBy the time Reese Witherspoon used baby buns to spice up her mom bob, the tide had already turned.facebook dialogPinterestMini BunsSorry, Heather Graham.facebook dialogPinterestChunky HighlightsEveryone got highlights in the '90s, and they wanted to make sure you knew it. Lightened sections were big, bright, and super-obvious. Gwyneth Paltrow and Brad Pitt were unforgettable in their his-and-hers zebra stripes.facebook dialogPinterestChunky HighlightsGeri Halliwell of the Spice Girls bleached just the front. The two-tone look was what she wanted, what she really, really wanted.facebook dialogPinterestChunky HighlightsJennie Garth applied her highlights with a paint roller.facebook dialogPinterestChunky HighlightsCourteney Cox tried it with darker colors in wine and brown. Still weird.facebook dialogPinterestEverything Is Wrong HereBehold, A.J. Langer from My So-Called Life, who wore every '90s beauty trend at the same time.

Mandatory // Play Today\u2019s MLB Sluggers With \u201990s Style Goatees Don't be afraid of the chin hair, fellas. by Gary Dudak Aug 19th, 2015 The \u201990s were a great time for the long ball, when Major League Baseball players regularly hit 50+ home runs and defied traditional power numbers. It was also a great time for the goatee, with sluggers like Mark McGwire, Jeff Bagwell, Ken Caminiti and Larry Walker regularly sporting them. This carried into the early 2000s with guys like Albert Pujols, but it seems to be lost on most of today\u2019s best hitters. That\u2019s a damn shame, too, because obviously they would look way more badass, as you can clearly see below.

Soul Patches The soul patch is, arguably, the most illogical of all 90's trends. The chin strap beard, while stupid, clearly said, \"I do too have a chin. I outlined it in my face hair. See?\" The goatee wordlessly declared, \"I'm an assh*le!\" So what did a soul patch say? \"The only thing I follow more religiously than minor league baseball is trends involving confused displays of masculinity.\" If you ever had a soul patch, please take a moment to stew in your shame. If you still have a soul patch, you've got a little barbecue sauce in there. 2. JNCOs Perhaps it was because of all of the Skip-It related chafing wounds, or just a general fondness for the feel of perpetually filthy shreds of fabric flopping against your calves, but, in the 90's, nothing was cooler than going to Kohl's with your mom to buy a fly new pair of JNCOs. WAS, being the operative word. We can all agree now that the circumference of your \"pipes\" should not exceed the length of your inseam. It just looks stupid. It doesn't matter how many yo-yo's you had stashed in there; no one needs that much room in their pants. 3. Leather Pants No one who was over the age of 11 at any point in the 90's made it through the decade without wondering, \"Could I pull off leather pants?\" The answer, ubiquitously, was, \"No,\" but Ricky Martin, Crazy Spice, and the actresses on Charmed were unrelenting in their desire to make leather pants last. In the end, the insane dry cleaning bills and the fact that you can't take anyone in leather pants seriously defeated this terrible trend. Just in case: no. You can't pull off leather pants. Don't try to bring them back. No. 4. Thug Looney Tunes Shirts Nothing proves the collective idiocy of the 90's more than the fact that a group of businessmen thought, \"People will probably buy T-shirts with Looney Tunes characters dressed in 'urban' attire,\" and then people actually bought them. This fad predated the safety mechanism of ironic fashion. If you wore an oversized T-shirt with a picture of Bugs Bunny wearing baggy, backwards jeans, you genuinely thought it was cool. At some point in the 90's, at least one person was probably held at gun point by someone in a gangster Tasmanian Devil T-shirt. Just think about that and vow to never let this fashion trend return. 5. Backwards Jeans Why was Bugs Bunny dressed in backwards jeans? Oh yeah. Because that was a thing people did. Specifically \"Mac Daddy\" and \"Daddy Mac\" of the hip-hop group Kris Kross. They are to blame for countless misplaced beepers and chaos at junior high urinals. This is the kind of trend that can only be discussed by using the phrase \"youth culture\" in the most crotchety tone of distanced disparagement, but, come on, you tried your jeans on backwards. Just don't try it again. Page 1 of 5Next Filed Under: soul patch90sLists Comments We like you. Do you like us too? Don't ask me again.

Even in the heat of the summer, the hairy trend continues to prevail. Still, if you think that\u2019s crazy, you probably missed the \u201990s. From about 1990-1998, some very weird facial hairstyles dominated the music world. There were a lot of incomplete goatees and quite a few runaway beards. Don\u2019t believe us? Check out some of the craziest and most \u201990s facial hair below\u2013 but we\u2019re warning you, you can never un-see what you\u2019re about to witness. 1 The Floating Goatee Getty Images A goatee is just a small patch of hair located on the chin. Seemingly simple, yet in the \u201990s, a lot of musicians literally missed the mark. John Dolmayan style was the perfect example of this nonchalant look, he had a soul patch just above his chin, so it wasn\u2019t quite a goatee, but it can\u2019t be disregarded all together. Hence, a new category is born: \u201cthe floater.\u201d 2 The Chin Mane Getty Images This exaggerated style still lives on today\u2013 ahem, Brad Pitt\u2013 but it was all the rage for rockers back in the day. Anthrax\u2019s lead guitarist Scott Ian not only sported this look, but he often dyed his mane. We\u2019re guessing to match his mood. 3 The Braided Beard Getty Images Shavo Odadjian clearly takes the cake when it comes to braided beards. The man had facial hair longer than the hair on most people\u2019s head. It wasn\u2019t a good luck, but it was very \u201990s. 4 The Landing Strip @artalexakis This style is pretty self-explanatory. It\u2019s a thin strip of hair that starts under the lip and ends wherever it wants. Please look to Art Alexakis for reference. The dad of three still rocks his classic style although no one else has since 1998. 5 Animal Style Sideburns Getty Images Sideburns alone aren\u2019t a \u201990s trend, but grooming those bad boys to your jawline? That\u2019s something that most men avoid these days. Back in his Limp Bizkit prime, Wes Borland sported some of the creepiest sideburns we\u2019ve ever seen. (Seriously, if his appearance in the \u201cNookie\u201d video doesn\u2019t haunt you, we don\u2019t know what will.) 6 The Hourglass Conundrum Getty Images Fred Durst rocked this style loud and proud in the \u201990s. His thin and oddly shaped beard closely resembled an hourglass. 7 The Dot Getty Images This style is similar to the \u201cfloating goatee\u201d with considerably less effort. As the name suggests, it is a literal dash of hair under your lip. Not very logical, but it was a trend all the same. 8 The 3-piece Masterpiece: A Combination Style [image src=\"wp-attachment://46414\"] Although this style combines three already horrible looks on the list, it has to stand on it\u2019s own for all of the musicians who rocked this exact look. Late Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain wore it best. Not only did Kurt\u2019s mustache connect to his beard, but he took it a step further by having a thin, two-part goatee that wasn\u2019t connected to anything.

Take The Longpigs for example, who tasted success with a couple of hits, though it was when everyone took their eye off the ball that Crispin Hunt produced his \u201899 chef d\u2019oeuvre, \u2018Mobile Home\u2019. No one bought it but that didn\u2019t make it any less brilliant. Image credit: Getty Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 2 of 50 Marion Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus Marion: In the mid-90s Macclesfield\u2019s Marion made lots of new friends touring with Radiohead, and their album \u2018This World and Body\u2019 was a classic for sensitive bedroom-dwelling eyelinered types with an aversion to sunlight. \u2018Sleep\u2019 made a top 20 splash, then singer Jaime Harding was arrested selling stolen garden gnomes for crack and things went downhill from there on in. Image credit: Press Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 3 of 50 Strangelove Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus Strangelove: Bristol\u2019s Strangelove were led by the wonderfully peculiar Patrick Duff, and they somehow channelled the spirit of glam rock and the darkness of Joy Division at the same time. Brett Anderson attempted to sprinkle stardust unto them when he recorded backing vocals on their \u2018Love and Other Demons\u2019 album, but the rest of the world wasn\u2019t quite ready and they dissolved in 1998. Image credit: Getty Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 4 of 50 My Life Story Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus My Life Story: Jack Shillingford apparently assembled his mini indie orchestra by stopping people on the London underground carrying musical instruments under their arms during the early 90s. The Marc Almond-inspired \u201812 Reasons Why I Love Her\u2019 was the first of a string of minor hits in the mid-90s and was quietly tremendous to boot. Image credit: Press Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 5 of 50 Babybird Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus Babybird: Everyone remembers \u2018You\u2019re Gorgeous\u2019, a sarcastic ode to the objectification of woman by sleazy photographers that would become the albatross around mainman Stephen Jones\u2019 neck. Jones had wildly prolific periods right up to 2012 when Babybird quit, but nothing ever came close to that success. Top tip to wedding DJs: \u2018You\u2019re Gorgeous\u2019 still fills a floor with dancing uncles. Image credit: Getty Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 6 of 50 Campag Velocet Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus Campag Velocet: Towards the end of the 90\u2019s Pete Voss\u2019 Portsmouth prowlers were unlikely NME cover stars, imbuing the menace of A Clockwork Orange had Alex\u2019s droogs developed an unhealthy fetish for cycling gear. These figureheads of Skunk Rock divided opinion, confused indie rock fans, though ultimately they remained a niche concern peaking at no.75 in the charts with \u2018Vito Satan\u2019. Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 7 of 50 Electronic Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus Electronic: Electronic was formed by two quintessential pillars of indie rock, but in the hubbub of all their other revered work of legend, it\u2019s easy to forget all about what Sumner and Marr did together for a few years in the 90s. \u2018Get The Message\u2019 was understated yet still somehow astonishing, and \u2018Getting Away With It\u2019 had Neil Tennant on it! A supergroup worth remembering then\u2026 Image credit: Getty Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 8 of 50 These Animal Men Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus These Animal Men: Brighton\u2019s These Animal Men had it all; the swagger, the cool threads, the major label deal and the rock star behaviour. The only thing they didn\u2019t really have was any hits. Arriving in a hailstorm of hype and riding the coattails of the New Wave of New Wave, they rattled on the top 75\u2019s door a few times before staggering off to bed. Image credit: Getty Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 9 of 50 Terris Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus Terris: Newport\u2019s much-hyped and woefully unsuccessful Terris are one of those bands whose activity straddles two millennia, though having formed in \u201898 and having broken up again in \u201802, that\u2019s about as interesting as it gets for this lot. NME loved them but the people voted with their feet and went to see Craig David instead. Some you win, some you lose\u2026 Image credit: Getty Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 10 of 50 King Adora Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus King Adora: King Adora were another band who emerged at the end of the millennium, proving to be the most exciting thing to come out of Birmingham since the pneumatic tyre, peaking shortly after the millenium with the glammy, booze-fuelled \u2018Vibrate You\u2019. Image credit: Getty Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 11 of 50 Mansun Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus Mansun: Mansun were much-loved by a barmy few in the mid-90s, and back when record companies had more money than sense, they memorably chucked away \u00a325,000 at Liverpool Street Station to promote single \u2018Taxloss\u2019. Imagine the boilersuits you could buy with that now. Their remaining rabid fans still hold out hope for reformation, but singer Paul Draper says \u2018no\u2019 about once every Tuesday. Image credit: Getty Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 12 of 50 Geneva Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus Geneva: Nude Records boss Saul Galpern certainly struck lucky when he signed Suede, though his other notable signings from the mid-90s \u2013 Geneva \u2013 didn\u2019t quite set the world alight in the same way. They did muster a few hits though, and those who heard angel-voiced East Kilbride-born singer Andrew Montgomery will not forget the experience in a hurry. Because it was lovely, that\u2019s why. Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 13 of 50 Kingmaker Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus Kingmaker: Early \u201990s Hull trio Kingmaker were feted by the music press for a while, but soon seemed like the naffest thing in the world soon after their moment in the sun. Image credit: Getty Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 14 of 50 Wheatus Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus Wheatus: Good god, it\u2019s Wheatus! They had a massive hit with \u2018Teenage Dirtbag\u2019 this lot, and if you don\u2019t like it then you should be ashamed; I mean come on, how can you hate a song that mentions Iron Maiden in the chorus? They also did a pretty great version of Erasure\u2019s \u2018A Little Respect\u2019, so you know, a little respect eh? Not too much though. Image credit: Getty Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 15 of 50 The Gin Blossoms Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus The Gin Blossoms: Named after the boozy condition rosacea (a reddening of the skin that sometimes becomes a bulbous red nose), this thirsty alternative rock band from Arizona had a massive radio hit with \u2018Hey Jealousy\u2019 in 1993. Unfortunately the writer of their winsome signature tune \u2013 guitarist Doug Hopkins \u2013 killed himself whilst being treated for alcoholism that same year. Image credit: Getty Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 16 of 50 Blind Melon Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus Blind Melon: Blind Melon had a really, really, really big hit in 1993 called \u2018No Rain\u2019 which is particularly memorable thanks to the Bee Girl in the video. They had some other songs that were quite good that no one remembers on account of the fact those songs didn\u2019t have videos featuring a Bee Girl. Image credit: Getty Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 17 of 50 Ultrasound Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus Ultrasound: Ultrasound were a late 90s indie band from Yorkshire who had a singer who looked a bit like Johnny Vegas who went by the name of Tiny. After one album and a falling out they dissolved in 1999, but last year they came back with a magnificent album called \u2018Play For Today\u2019, a record you\u2019ve almost certainly not checked out and one you would be foolish not to. Think on. Image credit: Getty Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 18 of 50 Salad Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus Salad: In the early 90s, Marianne Van Der Vlugt had a successful career as a VJ on MTV Europe, but was that enough for her? No it wasn\u2019t. The Dutch former model clearly thought she could do better and so formed Salad with some other musicians. Their debut album \u2018Drink Me\u2019 made no.16 in the UK charts. Image credit: Getty Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 19 of 50 Gay Dad Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus Gay Dad: Gay Dad were figures of both derision and suspicion in the late \u201890s, and most of it came from the fact founding member Cliff Jones used to write for Melody Maker and The Face. The poacher-turned-gamekeeper\u2019s \u2018To Earth With Love\u2019 was fine, the fairly execrable \u2018Joy!\u2019 ended up on a car ad. And that was about that. Image credit: Getty Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 20 of 50 The Wildhearts Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus The Wildhearts: He might have been know as David Leslie Walls to his mum, but to the rest of us he is Ginger. Since their inception at the end of the 80s, The Wildhearts have split up and reformed again no less than five times \u2013 whenever they split up they somehow end up rocking together again. Image credit: Getty Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 21 of 50 Curve Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus Curve: Back in the dark ages (ie the early 90s), Toni Halliday of Curve probably got more attention for her pulchritude than for her considerable talent in the music press, but she was a hero and an inspiration to many and without her the likes of Garbage and The Kills would sound very different indeed. Put on, say, \u2018Fait Accompli\u2019, and you\u2019ll see what we mean. Image credit: Getty Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 22 of 50 Regular Fries Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus Regular Fries: Baggy rose again in the late-90s under what some in the music press were calling Skunk Rock \u2013 a genre derived from the supposed penchant of its purveyors to smoke a bit of skunk. The drug, not the animal. Regular Fries made a psychedelic melange of big beats and searing guitar wig outs, and captivated their groovy north London fanbase until their premature conclusion in 2001. Image credit: Press Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 23 of 50 Rialto Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus Rialto: Louis Eliot of Rialto was so posh he made George Osborne look like Ozzy Osbourne \u2013 his surname comes from the Port Eliot family of the famous Cornish literary festival. It caused much suspicion among record buyers (who were a really suspicious lot in the 90s). Rialto\u2019s big hit \u2018Untouchable\u2019 was a thrilling indie romp which borrowed liberally from Wham!\u2019s \u2018Last Christmas.\u2019 Image credit: Press Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 24 of 50 David Devant and his Spirit Wife Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus David Devant and his Spirit Wife: Named after a 19th century magician, this band were led by The Vessel, the supposed conduit of the titular Victorian Paul Daniels. The Vessel was prone to shaving carrots on his head when playing live, as you do. The band still play now and again; go show some love to these undervalued stalwarts. Image credit: Getty Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 25 of 50 Crash Test Dummies Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus Crash Test Dummies: Altogether now in an impossibly deep voice: \u201cOnce there was this kid who\u2026\u201d This peculiar Manitoban five-piece had a massive hit in the UK with \u2018Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm\u2019 in the early 90\u2019s, thanks to some disproportionate patronage from Radio 1\u2019s Simon Mayo. A kind of mania swept the land and the slightly haunting tune landed at No.2. The rest of their stuff? Mmmm. Hmmmm\u2026 Image credit: Getty Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 26 of 50 Ugly Kid Joe Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus Ugly Kid Joe: It\u2019s odd to think these dumbass Californian surfer rock dudes reached double platinum status in the early 90s thanks to their MTV-approved monster smash \u2018Everything About You\u2019. The song was sort of like a love song, but wherever you\u2019d expect the word \u2018love\u2019, they changed it to \u2018hate\u2019. They then had another big hit with a Cat Stevens number before slipping into obscurity. Image credit: Getty Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 27 of 50 Scarfo Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus Scarfo: If you\u2019ve ever looked at Jamie Hince and thought \u2018Christ, he looks old, maybe he\u2019s just had a hard life,\u2019 the truth of the matter is he is actually quite old. Before the Kills he had an indie band called Scarfo and they did some quite nice tunes. Don\u2019t feel sorry for him, he\u2019s married to Kate Moss. Image credit: Press Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 28 of 50 Porno for Pyros Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus Porno for Pyros: Jane\u2019s Addiction are a band that have split up and got back together again even more times than The Wildhearts, Madness and The Libertines all rolled into one. During one sabbatical, Perry Farrell even took seriously the prospect of having another band for a while, hence Porno for Pyros. Their best song was \u2018Pets\u2019, though everyone thinks it\u2019s Jane\u2019s Addiction anyway. Image credit: Getty Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 29 of 50 Idlewild Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus Idlewild: Idlewild were a fantastic Scottish indie band who saw shapes and had a brilliantly monikered singer called Roddy Woomble. At some point they got rid of their ace drunken bass player Bob, headed off in a new bland REM b-sides direction and everyone yawned and forgot about them. Apparently they\u2019re back again, though Bob remains consigned to the dustbin of history. Shame. Image credit: Getty Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 30 of 50 My Drug Hell Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus My Drug Hell: My Drug Hell had their 15 minutes when secret indie obsessive Robbie Williams was snapped wearing their t-shirt, with the tabloids assuming he was commenting on his own life rather than just wearing the t-shirt of a band he was digging at the time. Image credit: Press Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 31 of 50 Babylon Zoo Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus Babylon Zoo: Jas Mann (not to be confused with Killing Joke\u2019s Jaz Coleman) must have exploded with joy when \u2018Spaceman\u2019 was chosen for the new Levis advert in 1995. The problem was, the bit chosen for the advert \u2013 the cool intro bit \u2013 was great, the song itself that proceeded afterwards was a bit of a drudge. Image credit: Getty Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 32 of 50 4 Non Blondes Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus 4 Non Blondes: It turns out Linda Perry of 4 Non Blondes was a way better songwriter than she was a singer. Everyone surely remembers \u2018What\u2019s Up\u2019. Since she broke the band up in \u201895, she\u2019s worked with Courtney Love, Gwen Stefani, Sugababes and most famously Christina Aguilera. She also recently married Darlene from Roseanne (actress Sara Gilbert)! Image credit: Getty Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 33 of 50 Belly Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus Belly: Tanya Donelly had made a name for herself in Throwing Muses and as a short-lived but founding member of The Breeders with Kim Deal, and then she struck gold again and had commercial success with Belly, despite taking the slang name for someone\u2019s abdomen. Their biggest hit \u2013 \u2018Gepetto\u2019 \u2013 was about the famous wooden toymaker who is currently being investigated by Operation Yewtree.

Image credit: Getty Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 35 of 50 White Town Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus White Town: What a peculiar tale this was, and one that could only really have happened in the 90s because a) people still gave a hoot about the charts and b) Mark Radcliffe had power. In fact Radcliffe rinsed this unknown quantity on his radio show and \u2018Your Woman\u2019 ended up at no.1. Jyoti Prakash never really did trouble the charts again, though some of his other stuff was quite good too. Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 36 of 50 Sneaker Pimps Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus Sneaker Pimps: Sneaker Pimps founder Chris Corner could never quite bring the attention back to himself once singer Kelli Ali departed the band, and the signature song she sang \u2013 \u20186 Underground\u2019 \u2013 simply refused to die! It did well on its release, and then was used in the movie version of The Saint, doing even better on its re-release. Chris later relocated to Berlin and formed IAMX. Image credit: Getty Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 37 of 50 Veruca Salt Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus Veruca Salt: Veruca Salt\u2019s name actually comes from the \u2018orrible spoilt kid in Roald Dahl\u2019s Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and then you think about what the words actually mean and vomit. Veruca Salt burst out of Chicago during the early 90\u2019s and because they were noisy and featured girls they were lazily categorised as Riot Grrrl by many, though they weren\u2019t. Not really. Image credit: Getty Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 38 of 50 Shack Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus Shack: Mick Head certainly had fans in the music press, but the admiration for his songwriting talents never really converted into record sales. He actually formed Shack with his brother in 1986, though much of the acclaim and the \u201clost genius\u201d tag were bestowed in the late 90s. Shack even signed to Noel Gallagher\u2019s Sour Mash label alongside those other notorious non starters, Proud Mary. Image credit: Getty Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 39 of 50 Stone Temple Pilots Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus Stone Temple Pilots: A poor man\u2019s Pearl Jam was often levelled at Stone Temple Pilots in the 90s, though to be fair, their second album \u2018Purple\u2019 in 1994 saw them develop their own more psychedelic rock direction. Okay, so this multi-platinum selling band are hardly forgotten, but perhaps they\u2019re a little unfairly derided, no?

An almost even bigger upset nearly occurred when the Auteurs narrowly missed out to Suede for the 1993 Mercury Prize. Haines says he\u2019ll never reform the Auteurs, a pity given none of his records (except maybe Baader Meinhof) have come close to the diabolical brilliance of the band\u2019s four underrated albums.

Singer Skin was still pinching herself on the night, and to be honest, none of us could believe it either. Time travel may not really exist, but put \u2018Hedonism\u2019 on this second and I swear to Christ you\u2019ll be transported back to the mid-90s in an instant.

Altogether now, \u201cshe\u2019s in the corner, giving the orders.\u201d Image credit: Press Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 43 of 50 3 Colours Red Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus 3 Colours Red: Although named after the Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski arthouse film of the same name, there was nothing highfalutin about these hard drinking, hard rocking miscreants (they apparently stuck a pin in Time Out when choosing their name). Signed to Alan McGee\u2019s Creation in the latter half of the 90s, the Chris McCormack-led bruisers cracked the top 20 of the UK album charts twice.

Singer Nick Sanderson played in late period Jesus and Mary Chain, and when he tragically died from lung cancer aged 47, the Reid brothers put their differences aside to play together at his funeral.

The Carmarthen warriors may not have worried the charts too much, but their five years together is now spoken about in reverent, hushed whispers having taken folk to somewhere spiky, interesting and delightful.

The Wannadies appeared on the soundtrack of the Baz Luhrmann version, and how we swooned at \u2018The You and Me Song\u2019. Such a glorious tune, and yet does anyone remember anything else they ever did? Do the band even remember?

Furter? Amen also featured Slayer\u2019s former drummer Dave Lombardo for a while, and how could you not rock with Dave Lombardo in the band? Answer: Amen did rock. Amen to that.

NME cover stars with much expected of them, they criminally only released one album \u2013 A Life With Brian \u2013 and split a few years later due to a lack of productivity. Sadly singer Liam Maher died of a heroin overdose in 2009.

Their debut 1999 EP \u2013 \u2018Mathematics\u2019 \u2013 is a lost classic, although not in France and Italy, where the group were rightfully cherished.

It all really depends where you picked up the trail, but the hairy Austin rockers and wanton destroyers of drumkits (sometimes two drum kits) actually formed in 1994. They\u2019re still going and their ninth album \u2013 cleverly titled \u2018IX\u2019 \u2013 is out later this year.

Maybe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not releasing any new material so watching them now promises to be only marginally more exciting than checking in with Kurt Cobain. \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0Or maybe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because their return was so unexpected, it's left me reeling with uncertainty.\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, what else from the 90's will return? Here are five fearless predictions: Advertisement 1. Lilith Fair Back in the mid 90\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bunch of ladies saw the success of Lollapalooza and decided to show the world that sisters could do it for themselves.\u00c2\u00a0 Soon a group of somewhat talented artists banded together united only by their one hit wonder status and lack of a penis.\u00c2\u00a0 Shawn Colvin, Meredith Brooks, Paula Cole, and others.\u00c2\u00a0 (I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d include Sarah McLachlan, but she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s had more than one hit and that would ruin my wild generalization.\u00c2\u00a0 Also, she never replied after I wrote that letter about kissing her so hard, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just going to assume she actually does have \u00c2\u00a0a penis.) Well in 2010, Lillith Fair will return with a vengeance.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 And not with Lady Gaga and Ke$ha flying the grrl-power banner. \u00c2\u00a0No, instead, our old friends will take to the stage with new anthems like Brooks\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a Bitch (Just Like This Menopause);\u00c2\u00a0 Colvin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cSonny Never Visits Anymore;\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 and Paula Cole\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cPiss Off Gladstone, I Had Two Hits.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The feisty music-loving college girls of the 90s will now be able to purchase tickets at Starbucks, Talbots, and, of course, Gymboree. 2. Bad Sex I hesitate to go here because after the Lillith Fair cracks I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d hate to be misunderstood as a misogynist.\u00c2\u00a0 But being misunderstood is what writing for the internet is all about.\u00c2\u00a0 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like a big game of \u00e2\u0080\u009cTelephone\u00e2\u0080\u009d that you play only with your deaf friends.\u00c2\u00a0 Who are also neurologically impaired. \u00c2\u00a0So here goes.\u00c2\u00a0 I know it may come as a surprise to you 21st century boys and girls, but women were different in the 90\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\u00c2\u00a0 This was before Sex and the City feminism took hold. Today, women hold onto the false delusion that they can empower themselves by tweeting \u00c2\u00a0frankly about how much they enjoy \u00c2\u00a0oral sex.\u00c2\u00a0 Where a frattish mentality of getting drunk and laid is somehow akin to saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a woman and I will not be denied !\u00e2\u0080\u009d Now, of course that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wrong-headed and false, but men don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t typically try to dispel that notion because, well why would we dissuade you from talking about oral sex?\u00c2\u00a0 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s much easier for dudes to say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re an independent woman. Now finish your beer and do that thing I like with the thing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But back in the 90\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, it was a different scene.\u00c2\u00a0 Intelligent, sexual women across the land (or at least at my University) wanted to run with the wolves while reading Naomi Wolfe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Beauty Myth.\u00c2\u00a0 They couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t put on make up or shave their legs without asking, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy am I doing this; are these the tools of my oppression; and how does Gladstone get so dreamy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the stats to prove this, but in the 90\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fewer asses got spanked during sex then any decade in modern history.\u00c2\u00a0 The 69 rose in prominence as the only accepted egalitarian form of oral sex. And for the first time in history, a frank dialogue about the magic and glory of the menses was considered foreplay. Well, get ready, because in 2010, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all coming back.\u00c2 \u2193 Continue Reading Below Sex and the City 2 will hit theaters and suddenly women will react in horror at the lifeless shell Carrie Bradshaw has become.\u00c2\u00a0 Soon Ani DiFranco records will start to sell again and French maid outfits will be returned in record numbers.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Your free ride is over fellas. Time to grow a pony tail and get some Indigo Girls records. 3. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThanks for Sharing\u00e2\u0080\u009d/\u00e2\u0080\u009dToo Much Information\u00e2\u0080\u009d Historians tell us that for a brief six week period in the fall of 1991, it was actually considered somewhat witty and/or clever to say \u00e2\u0080\u009cthanks for sharing\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009ctoo much information\u00e2\u0080\u009d when confronted with unwanted details from another\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal life.\u00c2\u00a0 We may never know why humor was ascribed to these phrases, but all our best data tells us it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true.\u00c2\u00a0 Indeed, even today, there are still clusters of humorless conversation trolls who feel empowered by using \u00c2\u00a0these phrases as if they were magical incantations, instantly transforming \u00c2\u00a0the speaker into a person more important than the addressee.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 They have no idea that every self-respecting human stopped saying this shortly before the start of the Clinton administration. Well they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in luck.\u00c2\u00a0 In 2010, a void will form in our language and welcome the unfortunate return of these phrases.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0Why?\u00c2\u00a0 Because in 2010 \u00e2\u0080\u009cFail\u00e2\u0080\u009d will finally leave the vernacular.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 (Incidentally, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmeh\u00e2\u0080\u009d will hold tight for another five years.) Soon, millions of the worst people in the world will be unsure what to say when being exposed to unexpected, unwanted information.\u00c2\u00a0 And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s when the TMI jargon returns. Some of you may be doubting this prediction.\u00c2\u00a0 How does it make sense to reply \u00e2\u0080\u009cthanks for sharing\u00e2\u0080\u009d to a youtube video you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t approve of? \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0Well , in truth, it makes no sense.\u00c2\u00a0 But then again, it was never really logical to say \u00e2\u0080\u009ctoo much information\u00e2\u0080\u009d to your co-worker when he was trying to open up to you about the death of his mother either. 4. Goatees Did you misread that? Not Goatse. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a 21st century creation.\u00c2\u00a0 No, I said \u00e2\u0080\u009cgoatee\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that tiny beard circling one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mouth that --much like Goatse-- \u00c2\u00a0actually does conjure thoughts of a-holes.\u00c2\u00a0 But in the 90\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it was part of the standard uniform.\u00c2\u00a0 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to believe, but just over a decade ago, this incomplete facial hair formation, could actually increase a guy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chances of having sex \u00e2\u0080\u0093 especially when coupled with long hair.\u00c2\u00a0 It was a look that said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey world, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a beard. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not clean-shaven either.\u00c2\u00a0 You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t define me with your boring rules. \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00c2\u00a0 And seriously what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sexier than that? In 2010, the goatee comes back stronger than ever. Why? Because of this column.\u00c2\u00a0 The power of the internet, baby.\u00c2\u00a0 Tomorrow morning, every guy who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s read this will stare in his bathroom mirror overcome by a certain sensation.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood lord, Gladstone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s onto something!\u00c2\u00a0 What if the ladies couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see the skin immediately around my mouth?\u00c2\u00a0 What if it appeared from the proper distance that I had a cinnamon donut stuck to my face?\u00c2\u00a0 Good lord, how much tail would that get me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 You may doubt it now, but it's already in play.\u00c2\u00a0 You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re already on your way. Congratulations, sexy! In fact, I just started a facebook group called \u00e2\u0080\u009cGoatees for 2010\u00e2\u0080\u009d to get this baby going.\u00c2\u00a0 If the group gets, over 100 members with pics posted, I promise to post too. (I understand it will take a few days to get the facial hair in place).\u00c2\u00a0 I will also do my best to get the other Cracked columnists to do so \u00e2\u0080\u0093 understanding, of course that Daniel O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Brien and Michael Swaim may lack the testerone-based fortitude to achieve such things. 5. Full House Hey remember one of the worst sitcoms ever? No? Why? Because you were 5? Oh.\u00c2\u00a0 Well what about syndication? Yes, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m talking about Full House. That show about a Jewish guy who was somehow named Tanner and not actually Jewish who had to raise two baby troll dolls after his wife died. Thinking fast, he recruits John Stamos and Dave Coulier to help out.\u00c2\u00a0 The show ran from 1987 to 1995 and I imagine it sucked the entire length of that time, but truth be told, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure I ever saw a full episode. In any event, in 2010, Full House returns.\u00c2\u00a0 Not a remake.\u00c2\u00a0 All the same actors return in modern day.\u00c2\u00a0 The make-shift family will reunite to help the Olson twins deal with their eating disorders.\u00c2\u00a0 Bob Saget, once known for being funny and one of the dirtiest stand ups prior to Full House, will now drop F bombs non stop.\u00c2\u00a0 And Dave Coulier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s catch phrase will be \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey, y\u00e2\u0080\u0099know Alanis Morrissette was totally talking about going down on me in that theater.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe me?\u00c2\u00a0 Doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sound right for TV? What if I told you the cast did the whole show in black face and it was called Tyler Perry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Full House of Payne?\u00c2\u00a0 Yep. Believe it.\u00c2\u00a0 Enjoy your 2010, guys.

                            "text": "Music Film Television Books Webcomics Current Events Consumerism Podcast The 9 Worst Legacies of \u201990s Pop Culture July 24, 2013 Chris Holmes Facebook Twitter Chris Holmes joined the Popdose writing staff only after enduring a humiliating series of hazing rituals. One day he'll write a tell-all book, and then they'll all pay. Until then, you can also catch him at his regular home, The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit, or you can follow him on Twitter. Most unfortunate pop culture trends from the \u201990s are dead and gone, but here are nine that live on like annoying zombies. The good thing about pop culture trends is that most of them, while shitty, go away eventually. But some of them, like that nasty case of herpes you picked up your freshman year in college, never really vanish for good. They either hang around undiluted or just morph into something slightly different. Here are nine such pop culture legacies from a decade that couldn\u2019t end quickly enough if you ask me: the \u201990s. Note for the nitpickers: While some of these things did not necessarily begin in the 1990s, they came to prominence then. So there. The Goatee If you\u2019re reading this and are currently sporting a goatee, do the rest of us a favor and shave that shit off. Right now. What the pornstache was to the \u201970s or the mullet was to the \u201980s, the goatee was to the \u201990s \u2014 a grooming relic best left to those painfully unfunny VH1 retrospective clip shows. The only people who can still get away with that look are actors, athletes, and Evil Spock. So either be a man and commit to the full beard like the rest of us or be done with it. Beanie Babies Now worth DOZENS of dollars. To be fair, Beanie Babies weren\u2019t the first useless item people lost their collective shit over; nor will they be the last. But with most hot toys, the secondary market explodes because the manufacturer can\u2019t keep up with demand. What made Beanie Babies especially annoying (and therefore worthy of this list) was that Ty Inc. artificially kept the supply of individual animals low by \u201cretiring\u201d them. Because God forbid they produce a few thousand more stuffed ducks to prevent a bunch of bored housewives from rioting. This kind of bullshit marketing ploy is now commonplace, to the point where every piece of junk companies pump out is instantly labeled a collector\u2019s item. The absolute nadir of the Beanie Baby craze came in 1996, the first year of the McDonald\u2019s Teenie Beanie Apocalypse. People waited on line for hours and even got into fights, all for the privilege of owning a smaller version of an already useless stuffed toy. But this story does have a happy ending. All those little sacks of stuffing that were treated like gold back then are now no more valuable than most other toys from the era. A recent eBay auction for 65 Teenie Beanies sold for a whopping $23.01. Even that\u2019s a ripoff if you ask me. Adam Sandler Twice as douchetastic. It\u2019s not that I think Adam Sandler lacks talent. He was pretty funny on Saturday Night Live, and I never pass up an opportunity to watch The Wedding Singer on cable. But if there\u2019s an entertainer from the \u201990s who has squeezed more out of his blatantly limited range of ability, I can\u2019t think of one. My brain cannot process the fact that the guy who I first saw as a funny but fairly forgettable bit player on the old Remote Control game show was given money by Hollywood to release a hateful piece of shit like Jack and Jill a few decades later. It\u2019s like his level of success is inversely proportional to how insultingly stupid his projects are. Worst of all, Adam Sandler is the sole reason Rob Schneider isn\u2019t giving handies for meth money in some dank Hollywood alley. I will never forgive him for that. Country Pop I\u2019ll admit that I was never a huge country fan to begin with, but I can at least respect the old school. Johnny Cash, Hank Williams, Willie Nelson, and Waylon Jennings \u2014 this to me is what country music is all about. Not the homogenized, twangy pop pabulum that\u2019s come to represent the genre over the last 20-plus years. Sure, there\u2019s been a huge strain of pop music intertwined with country going all the way back to the days of Countrypolitan in the \u201950s and \u201960s. But Shania Twain, Billy Ray Cyrus, Carrie Underwood, and Taylor Swift? Are you sure Hank done it this way? Multiple Covers Four different covers of X-Men #1. Like a license to print Nerd Bucks. This crap may not have started in the comic book industry, but it sure took hold in a big way there. Publishers realized that they had a hot thing on their hands and, as executives are wont to do, got greedy. Want to move a lot of product but can\u2019t be bothered with writing more stories? Just publish the same damn issue multiple times and slap a different cover on each one. Genius! But it doesn\u2019t stop there, and it hasn\u2019t stopped yet. While a case could possibly be made for wanting multiple comic book covers, I can think of no good excuse for the same from esteemed publications like TV Guide or Cosmopolitan. And yet here we are. Three times as pointless. The Death of Mass Cultural Experiences This one may be a bit of a reach, but work with me. Depending on your viewpoint, the explosion of cable television, the internet, and musical choices in the \u201990s was a double-edged sword. On the one hand, people had more choices than ever before for entertainment. But the downside, as far as I\u2019m concerned anyway, is that the age of the shared cultural experience died for good. Take music as an example, think about it \u2014 what bands have come along since the \u201990s that have effectively taken over our mass consciousness, even if for a little while? I would argue that since Michael Jackson\u2019s heyday, or perhaps even Prince or Bruce Springsteen, you don\u2019t get acts that sell a shit ton of albums and are also impossible to ignore. These days \u2014 and I\u2019m veering dangerously close to Bob Lefsetz territory, admittedly \u2014 the music market is so fragmented that very few top-selling acts actually seep into the brains of non-fans. The same goes for TV. The final episode of M*A*S*H aired in 1983 and drew 125+ million viewers, or seventy-seven percent of all American TV viewers. The only series finale from the last decade to crack the top 10 of that list was for Friends, which drew less than half the viewers and just over half the market share. And I\u2019d wager that more people remember watching the M*A*S*H finale. That\u2019s not to say that we don\u2019t still have extremely popular media. But more and more, the people who enjoy a band or a book or a show are all already fans, and they\u2019re all high-fiving each other in the same little silo. I think the Harry Potter franchise did achieve that breakthrough, so perhaps I\u2019m being premature here. OK, back to the snark. Cash Cow Band Reunions The next time you purchase (or try to) a ticket for a so-called legacy act and then realize that you\u2019d need to sell a few pints of blood just to cover the convenience charge, thank these douchebags: Well at least the two d-bags in the middle. By the time the Eagles hit the road for their Hell Freezes Over tour in 1994, they turned out to be the beneficiaries of a unique convergence between music and demographics. Their core fanbase, the Baby Boomers, were cruising into middle age and their prime earning years, and were more than willing to spend triple figures to relive their youth. Which would be all well and good, but it turned out that Messrs. Henley and friends had little interest in recording new music. In fact it would be 13 years before the reformed band released a proper studio album. In the meantime they went on two more massive, highly lucrative tours. Other bands followed suit in the following years, such as Kiss, the Who, and even the Police. Of course I\u2019m a willing accomplice to an extent, having seen Kiss twice in \u201996 and the Police in 2007, but I can tell you neither was cheap. Collecting As a Business Instead of a Hobby \u201cI\u2019ll go $5 on the Barry Bonds rookie card, but if even one corner is bent I\u2019ll break your legs.\u201d I remember the day I realized that comic books had stopped being fun, and it had nothing to do with finally kissing a girl. I was in one of those permanent flea markets, looking for an old issue of The Avengers\u00a0or Archie or something like that. I walked toward the counter and saw a kid, who couldn\u2019t have been more than 8 or 9 years old, haggling with the store owner over a comic like he was trying to broker a peace deal at Camp David. I put my stuff back, walked out, and never came back. By the 1990s, comic books and sports cards had stopped being pieces of colorful paper for kids and adult fans to accrue and enjoy. They became commodities to be hoarded, speculated on, and dealt like shares of stock or bars of gold. You didn\u2019t dare handle one too much for fear of losing value. This is partly to blame for what turned into the comic book bubble of the early \u201990s. (For more on that, read any of the great and insightful essays by Mile High Comics founder Chuck Rozanski.) Likewise, baseball cards underwent a similar boom period, only to crash in the \u201990s. It\u2019s why cards that you spent a few dozen dollars on then can be had for a fraction of that now on eBay. And while that\u2019s probably as it should be, it just sucks that what was supposed to be a fun hobby turned countless kids into little Gordon Gekkos* in the process. *I\u2019m old and out of touch. Can someone give me a more current reference point for greed than Gordon Gekko? EXTREME (not the band) I get it. Attitude sells. It\u2019s been the case for decades. My main issue with the still-quite-pervasive trend of marketing things as \u201cextreme\u201d is that most of them just aren\u2019t. It\u2019s really just a cynical attempt by corporate executives to dupe people into believing that they have have had instant coolness imbued upon them just by consuming one mass-marketed product over another. Take, for example, one of the prime offenders in the realm of EXTREME marketing \u2014 Mountain Dew. Oh sorry, I meant Mtn. Dew. Here\u2019s one of their decidedly un-extreme \u00a0TV spots from the mid \u201980s. Not very in your face, is it? But add some screaming guitars, extreme cross-training (another fucking term I can\u2019t get enough of), and a de-mulleted tennis star, and you\u2019re ready to ditch those rednecks and DO THE DEW. While Agassi may be gone, the extreme-ness remains. And since the \u201990s it has spread like a damn virus to just about every consumer product imaginable \u2014 from jeans to snack chips to baby carrots. Yes, not even\u00a0baby carrots\u00a0are immune to the X-Games-ification of American culture.
