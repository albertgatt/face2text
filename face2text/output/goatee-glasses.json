            "51": "Jane Fryer interviews Heston Blumenthal and tries to cook some recipes from his new book\nHeston Blumenthal bounds about like an enormous over-excited orange dog. He can\u2019t be still. He sits down, jumps up, waves his arms about, bursts out laughing, sits, scratches, does enormous yawny stretches and giggles.\nYes, he giggles at pretty much anything \u2014 practical jokes, drunken japes, and getting into trouble on his annual (\u2018very liquid\u2019) lads\u2019 ski trip where there \u2018always seems to be a freakish accident of some sort\u2019.\nHis chat veers between his Michelin stars (he won his sixth, for London restaurant Dinner, last month), daft experiments with liquid nitrogen and bananas, and extreme exercise (despite having had an operation on his shoulder, titanium rods inserted into his lower back and needing a new hip).\nHe also has a lot to say about sweating (\u2018I\u2019m a massive, massive sweater. I sweat constantly. I can\u2019t stop.\u2019) and hair.\n\u2018Course  I\u2019m not bald! There\u2019s loads and loads of it \u2014 far too much if you sweat  like me. So I shave it twice a week. Someone said to me the other week I  was an insult to bald people because I pretend to be bald!\n\u2018It\u2019s not curly, but it\u2019s thick, thick, thick, like the Hair Bear Bunch.\u2019\nGosh.  So does he have 20-20 vision, too? Are those trademark massive specs  also just for show? \u2018Nah. But I didn\u2019t need glasses until I was 40. I  remember sitting in the restaurant after service one night doing the  ordering and thinking: \u201cI can\u2019t bloody see.\u201d \u2019\nBut always specs \u2014 never contact lenses, or even laser surgery?\nHis explanation is rather convoluted \u2014 involving a friendly fight with his mate Lee Dixon, the former Arsenal and England footballer, on a ski trip. Heston tried to shove a loo roll in Lee\u2019s mouth. Lee retaliated by hitting Heston with a toilet brush. The bleach, unfortunately, went in his eye and he had to have hospital treatment to get the front surface of his eye peeled off.\nHeston is accident-prone. He also broke his shoulder on another skiing holiday after crashing while wearing headphones.\nHe\u2019s a bit of a surprise. I\u2019d expected a nerdy obsessive with a furious temper constantly boiling over in his science lab/ kitchen.\nThis is, after all, the man who used to peel peas to get the perfect texture, woke his now ex-wife up at 2am to taste endless cr\u00e8me brulee recipes and translated a French cookery book word by word, using a French/English dictionary when he was 15 (while not being able to speak French).\nRELATED ARTICLES\nShare\nA man who taught himself to cook, opened his first restaurant (the Fat Duck) in 1995 and nearly went mad (and bankrupt) in his mission to introduce the nation to snail porridge and bacon and egg ice cream.\n\u2018The worst bit was probably the first eight years. I didn\u2019t miss a meal service \u2014 so that was 120 hours a week. For eight years I\u2019d function on two or three hours\u2019 sleep a night. I went totally delirious.\u2019\nOn one occasion he tried to light a blow-torch with the hot tap instead of a match. He fell asleep while filleting fish. \u2018I looked down and there was all this hacked up fish, I could have cut my fingers off. I lived on adrenaline.\u2019\nBut now things have calmed down a little, he\u2019s splendid company \u2014 incredibly enthusiastic, pleasingly puerile and overflowing with energy. He\u2019s constantly jetting off round the world making TV shows, expanding his food empire, and putting his name to toasted sandwich-makers and whisks.\nHe\u2019s also still writing cookery books \u2014 his latest is Historic Heston in which, after years of research and experimentation, he recreates ancient British recipes such as quaking pudding (a baked custard that quivers like jelly) and powdered duck (\u2018powdered\u2019 being an old word for \u2018brined\u2019).\nIt\u2019s a beautiful book, part-recipe book and part brilliantly interesting history of food \u2014 but at \u00a3125 it is destined for superior coffee tables rather than kitchen shelves.\nMoving on: Blumenthal, pictured here GQ Men Of The Year Awards in 2012, left his wife last year for American cookery writer Suzanne Pirret\nAmbitious: Heston, pictured with Jeremy Hunt at a Buckingham Palace reception last year, taught himself to cook and aged 15 translated a french cookery book word by word using a dictionary so he could make the recipes\n\u2018They are proper recipes, just as we make them in my restaurants, but I\u2019m not really expecting people to cook them,\u2019 he says. The \u2018most extreme\u2019 is mock turtle soup which he says is \u2018impossible because you need all sorts of kit\u2019 \u2014 indeed, the recipe stretches over three pages.\nHis methods have always been extreme. Years ago, the preparation for one recipe involved getting a piece of ham and running it under a tap for 48 hours. He had a sackful of complaint letters about the waste of water. \u2018What an idiot!\u2019 he says with a rueful laugh.\nHe hasn\u2019t always been this buoyant. This is the all-new, well-rested, heavily therapised Heston \u2014 he\u2019s been seeing what he calls his \u2018life/career/goal coach\u2019 regularly for more than 12 years.\n\u2018I\u2019m better now. I\u2019m not quite so, well, you know . . . I used to send emails at 2am before I went to bed and get up at four and start chasing for replies. Now I get up at 6.30am. When I open my eyes, it\u2019s like DONG! and that\u2019s it. I love getting up. I don\u2019t want to miss anything.\u2019\nSo are the rumours true \u2014 did he have a terrible temper?\nPride and joy: Heston pictured in his kitchen at Fat Duck in Bray, he opened the restaurant in 1995 and then spent eight years working 120 hour weeks to make it a success\n\u2018Yes. Fairly strong. Put it this way,  some of my staff wore World War I helmets in the kitchen. And I had a  few road rage issues.\u2019 He admits having \u2018hauled\u2019 other motorists out of  their cars. \u2018Once, I really went for someone. I was in my car and chased  someone right down the middle of a High Street \u2014 in reverse.\u2019\nDid he ever injure anyone? \u2018Er, well yes. I wasn\u2019t very good at expressing emotion, so it was much easier to punch people. It was almost bordering on the psychotic.\n\u2018Oh God, and there was that thing with the gun and the meat cleaver. Some cowboy builders sent some heavies round to my gran\u2019s to get their money and I lost it and pulled a gun out \u2014 my dad had it for shooting crows \u2014 and chased them with a meat cleaver. They didn\u2019t get their money.\u2019\nBlimey. How often does he lose his temper these days? \u2018Never. No, not even in a car. The most I\u2019d do is a very, very controlled \u201cshush\u201d.\u2019\nAnd it\u2019s all down to therapy. His special Heston mantra is: \u2018As part of who I am now, there are three emotions \u2014 blame, shame and guilt and they are all driven by stuff that\u2019s already happened and you can\u2019t change it.\u2019\nWhich sounds convenient \u2014 if rather galling for Zanna, the wife of 20 years whom he credited as \u2018the reason for my success\u2019, and whom he left last year for American cookery writer Suzanne Pirret.\n'The reason for my success': Zanna who supported Heston while he built his empire, worked tirelessly as a nurse and raising their three children now aged 21, 20 and 16 before being unceremoniously dumped by Blumenthal after 20 years together\nWhile he slaved away over his Bunsen  burner at the Fat Duck, Zanna worked as a nurse, paid all the bills and  raised their three children (now 21, 20 and 16).\nShe also helped him weather endless stroppy letters from the bank, a highly damaging dose of mass food poisoning at the Fat Duck in 2009 and an unhappy falling out with his Little Chef partners after he helped reinvigorate one of their outlets for a Channel 4 show.\nHe says: \u2018After the TV show, they wanted me to be a named consultant, and I wanted to be behind the scenes. Then they changed the supply chain and cut the cost of the ingredients and the quality went down. It was rubbish and they kept trying to link my name in. I was really p***** off.\u2019 Relations with Zanna are good, he says, but while he\u2019s calmer and jollier than he used to be, he is no less obsessive. He still does everything to extremes. Whether it\u2019s drinking, cooking, designing spectacles (\u2018I\u2019ve done this brilliant pair covered in salmon leather, you know, fish skin!\u2019), or choosing his selection for Desert Island Discs.\n\u2018I took 300 CDs on holiday and listened to each track for ten seconds. I wanted to make sure I conjured up the tracks that triggered a memory. I found it really relaxing, but I drove my family mad. But it\u2019s worth doing things properly.\u2019\nAn obsession with exercise \u2014 martial arts, weights, running, cycling, racket ball, skiing and boxing, often twice a day \u2014 means he now needs that new hip, if only he could find the time for the op.\n\u2018My diary is booked up until April or May next year already. But I\u2019m not nervous about the surgery. In fact, do you know, I\u2019ll quite enjoy it \u2014 it will be an enforced rest.\u2019\nFall out: Pictured with Abe Rogers, for the Channel 4 show Big Chef takes on Little Chef, Heston endured a row with the brand after they wanted to link him as a named consultant\nExercise fanatic: Despite having titanium rods inserted in his lower back and needing a hip replacement Heston, pictured here as a celebrity guest on Ski Sunday, still works out twice a day and loves martial arts, running, skiing and boxing\nThe last time he had a major operation \u2014 a five-hour procedure to insert two titanium rods at the base of his spine because of a degenerative problem (the result of years of hunching over cookers) \u2014 he was summoning meetings in his hospital room the same day.\nMeanwhile, he continues to work out madly \u2014 pushing through the pain, often twice a day. He needs to keep his whirring brain \u2014 which he confesses never sleeps \u2014 in check.\n\u2018It doesn\u2019t seem to stop \u2014 although sometimes I\u2019d really rather it did. I\u2019ve been trying meditation for six years, but I\u2019m not very good at it.\n\u2018I\u2019m constantly curious and never satisfied. I always think I can get better.\u2019 He says he never showed signs of being such perfectionist when he was young.\n\u2018I wasn\u2019t even particularly bright. I got an A-level in Art but that was a fluke because there were never any questions about the artists I learned about for my art history exam.\u2019 He passed six O-levels \u2014 but failed chemistry.\nHeston is also comically clumsy. He once gave himself frostbite of the tongue after eating a banana frozen with liquid nitrogen \u2014 \u2018I just didn\u2019t think, but it was bloody cold.\u2019\nOn another occasion, his oven blew up (\u2018and I burnt my head!\u2019).\nAnd then there was the self-administered water poisoning.\n\u2018I imported this brilliant fizzy water from France and I was so excited I must have drunk about five or six litres. But then I had this terrible pain \u2014 it was mineral poisoning. You can die from that.\u2019\nOf course, Heston Blumenthal is a bit of an idiot, a selfish obsessive, almost certainly absolutely impossible to live with and more than a little strange. But as top chefs go, he\u2019s really very likeable.\nJust whatever you do, don\u2019t ever go skiing with him \u2014 or go to one of his restaurants and complain, if he\u2019s holding a meat cleaver.\nn Historic Heston by Heston Blumenthal is published by Bloomsbury at \u00a3125.

            "80": "Connect, share information & access knowledge from millions of women worldwide per week.\n\u00a0\nWell, it's that time of year. Where you see a lot of friends' relationship statuses going from 'in a relationship' to 'engaged'. You get so excited inside to see how the post has 500+ likes and that the couple looks about as happy as those you see in the generic picture that sits in a new\u00a0frame before you buy it. You are so happy for them, yet somewhere inside you there is a pesky thought occurring -- 'what about me' and 'when will it be my\u00a0turn'.\u00a0\nI am here to tell you ladies that we have all gone through this phase of life in the 20s/30s,\u00a0and you are not alone in having that paralyzing fear of 'what if I never get to change my Facebook status'. (Isn't it amazing how Facebook has totally disrupted our lives?)\u00a0\nThat alone feeling can be compared to how you felt in elementary school when you were the last one picked on the kickball team, or the last one to be asked to that lame middle school dance. Yep. It hurts. And it doesn't get any easier the older you get when\u00a0little by little all your friends start to couple off, making you feel like a third wheel at events. What's worse is when they try to marry you off out of seeing how sad you are after\u00a0going through so many frogs that they start to set you up with anyone and everyone. I mean, everyone. Ughhh. I mean, I'm sure the guy is nice, but...\nCredit: politicalhotwire.com\nSpeaking from experience, I had a friend who\u00a0tried to set me up with her way older, bald, overweight\u00a0friend who was \"super sweet\" and \"totally into me after seeing my picture\". I mean, thanks, I'm sure he's great, but just because I'm single and feel like I'm the last one picked on the kickball team, it doesn't mean I want to be matched with the other person who is left in the center of the field waiting to be placed on a team.\u00a0To me, it is\u00a0better to be patient, remain single and just trust that the right (not perfect)\u00a0person will come when he should.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n1. Focus on career. While you're waiting for Mr. Right to come into the picture, you might as well strive to get your professional ducks in a row. The more solid you are in this area, chances are the more likely you will be ready to let someone in down the line. Also, you never know who you could meet while at career-oriented events.\u00a0\nCredit:\u00a0www.jasonshen.com\n\u00a0\n2. Set goals for yourself, both personal and professional. Wanting to eat healthier in the new year, work out more, or make a career move? What better time to do so than when you are single and do not have a responsibility to anyone else? Again, the more solid and happy you are with yourself, the more likely you will be open to someone great entering into your life. Writing out an actual list early in the new year is a great idea and it helps to see the goals laid out on paper.\u00a0\nRelated Job\n\u00a0\n3. Give to others and stay active in the community. It can be easy to get down sometimes if you are single, but a great way to combat that feeling is to stay out and give back to society through volunteering for a nonprofit in which you are passionate about the cause. Also, you never know who you might meet...\nCredit: collegemagazine.com\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n5. Remember to ENJOY being single. I bet that, at times, couples look back and remember their long gone days of being single with a fondness and a sense of nostalgia. As great as it is to find your love, there are a lot of strings that come with a long-term relationship. Therefore, even though being single can be lonely, remember to embrace the freedom and opportunity that comes with this phase of your life. This will more than likely be harder to do with friends once you are married...\nCredit: Huffington Post\nYou Might Also Like\nWant an amazing job or internship?\nJoin millions of women who have found their dream jobs and internships on Mogul.\n14h\n12h\n12h\nTop Answer\nThat's a tough question to answer.

Bonus points if they are also weirdos and/or freaks.\nIn my own mind I've always looked like some combination of a young Iggy Pop and Prince.\nIn reality, though (sigh)... I'm a stocky hairy dude with very wide shoulders who needs to exercise extravagantly to not look like a buffalo. I will never be skinny no matter what I do.\nAnd I'm bald. And in my mid-forties.\nI refuse, however, to accept that I can't be fashionable and/or hip, or at least dress in a way that expresses who I feel that I am.\nI think that I just need to find a way to play to my strengths... in short, I need fashion role models that are stocky and/or balding men.\nBonus points if they are also weirdos and/or freaks, though I'm willing to accept that maybe I just can't pull that off. Your suggestions please!\n\u00a0\nGraham McTavish from The Hobbit manages to wear a kilt EXTREMELY well . I can't say I endorse the shoes he pairs with it, but otherwise this is a great look.\nDon Urban is an Australian designer who makes and often models his own line of mens clothing .  I only just noticed after many years of following that he is not in fact bald, he just favors hats, but I think he might check a few boxes for you, if you like the modern deconstructed look.\nErroneous, the stocky/weirdo guy look is really in right now!\nGoogle images for lumbersexual.\nI don't know of any blogs offhand but this style is really in now and it works better on men that are stocky and look the part!\nMy friend Eric is a party photographer who always looks great and fits in everywhere from all ages punk fests to private sex parties.\nAnd when I look at those images, I see him doing a lot of things that make sense to me as a fellow stocky guy;\n- Lots of solid colors, the pizazz comes from which colors and color combinations you use. Lots of contrast between the pieces, or an ensemble that stays in one color palette (all blues, all blacks, all grays) but still with contrast via shades and patterns.\n- Branching out from totally solid colors, one piece can be something relatively over-the-top; sequins or sparkles even. I've gotten compliments wearing a fairly shiny sharkskin jacket, or a double-breasted pinstripe, or even a smoking jacket.\n- Accessories. Glasses, pins, buttons, scarves, watches, suspenders, belts, ties, pocket squares, maybe even hats are ways to step outside the bounds of \"ordinary\" men's clothing.\nMy personal 2 \u00a2 as a fellow bald stocky middle-aged guy;\n- Google-imaging \"lumbersexual\" just gets me a buncha pics of ordinary skinny good-looking guys only they've got thick beards and are wearing plaid shirts. I dunno that that helps much, and TBH a plaid shirt on a middle aged guy probably doesn't really come across as \"fashionable\" as much as just normal wear, or even that you wish it was still the 90's and grunge was king.\n- A \"rock & roll\" look (I kinda can't believe I just typed that) with lots of black and leather usually works pretty well.\n- Outside of flannel shirts, most ordinary checks and plaids don't tend to do us stocky guys any favors, IMO. And I wouldn't call them \"fashionable\" for middle-aged guys, you just look like George Costanza.\n- \"Skinny\" pants are seriously the worst idea, you'll just look like a balloon on a string. Straight leg or a slight taper at most to your pants legs.\n- Solid, \"heavier\" shoes with a thick sole, like Doc Martins or similar. A shoe that's too slim or delicate makes us look almost literally unbalanced, like there's nothing supporting the solidity of the rest of our bodies.\n- It's All About The Fit. Really, you could probably apply almost any men's fashion advice or ideas, but your clothes have to fit right. Too tight and we look like sausages about to burst from our casings (and we feel that way, too, which is uncomfortable and makes us move funny), too loose and we look like we're wearing a deflated hot air balloon. In practice this means you should get friendly with a local place that can do alterations to what you buy off the rack, and/or be willing to spend some time searching for the handful of articles of clothing that will fit just right.\nAlso, how bald are you? Because if you haven't tried the full-on shaved head or \"peach-fuzz\" almost-shaved buzz-cut you totally should. That's the way to own your baldness.\nAnother idea would be the Angel Batista character from the Dexter TV show. He does a lot of colorful patterned shirts, and that blocky square-cut shape (not tucked in) tends to look good on us blocky guys. Similar shape but different colors & patterns in \"bowling\" or \"work\" (esp. Dickies) shirts.\nSome googling found this blog which seems like it's got a pretty huge variety of looks that you could use for inspiration.\nposted by MsMolly at 10:36 PM on April 27, 2015\nThis guy also has some amazing looks that might be in your \"weirdo\" wheelhouse.\nNot a man (nonbinary femme), but you may enjoy some of PhatPhemme 's looks\nI dunno, you'd be hard put to notice it from the page of google image results - the look is conservative and muted - but you can't take your eyes of this guy when he's on the screen. I think it's the self-possession and the confidence, as he is in fact, plain, short, bandy-legged, bald and fat. Also much much better without any hair on his head at all.\n\u00ab Older Take my uterus, please! \u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0 Night guard for non-grinders?  Worthwhile or just...

            "7": "Notice! HomeHero is no longer accepting new clients or caregivers as of February 24th, 2017. Learn More\nBy Steven Richmond \u2022Oct 9th, 2015 Blog / Lifestyle\nHalloween isn\u2019t the only holiday in October \u2013 today is Bald and Free Day , a time to celebrate chrome domes everywhere.\nThere are many perks to not having hair: you save money on hair care products, you never have to worry about hat hair and you\u2019re naturally more aerodynamic.\nBut if you\u2019re new to being bald, or you\u2019re caring for a senior with full-blown baldness, you might not know the best techniques to care for an exposed scalp and look good in the process.\nCheck out these seven tips for looking flawless when you\u2019re hairless.\n1. Commit to the bald look\nHow do you it\u2019s time to shave it all off? According to hair re-growth specialist Dr. Alex Khadavi , there are a few signs to indicate you\u2019re on the road to male pattern baldness.\n\u201cNormally we shed 50-100 hairs a day, most people don\u2019t become alarmed to that until they start noticing their scalp more or recession in widow\u2019s peak,\u201d Khadavi said.\nYou don\u2019t want to be that guy trying to keep up appearances with thinning hair. Combovers, toup\u00e9es and that bowl cut monks use are never going to come back in style.\nIf your hairline hasn\u2019t receded entirely to the back of your head, you could spend some time with a close buzz cut as a way to dip your toes into the pool of baldness. But it may be advantageous to commit to a close shave to the sides or a completely barren look.\n\u201cDo what matches your head and proportionalize your face to your hair,\u201d Khadavi said.\nBut whatever you choose, do so with conviction and stick with it.\n2. Understand your head before you shave it\nYou don\u2019t need to be an expert in phrenology (the study of cranial contours), but it would behoove you to take time to understand the scalp you\u2019re shaving before you whip out the clippers.\nWhy is this important? It\u2019s very easy to knick, cut, scrape or otherwise damage scalp if it\u2019s your first time shaving off a head full of hair. This is doubly true if you or the senior you\u2019re caring for has Parkinsons ( luckily HomeHero has plenty of qualified caregivers ready to help ).\nTake time to find any scars, moles and other protruding features before shaving off hair. Damaging your scalp could leave unsightly scars.\n3. Prepare the hair (or beware)\nShaving your hair on your head isn\u2019t unlike shaving the hair on your face. Be sure to follow all the typical pre-shaving rituals you normally would.\nThis includes: *Washing the hair with warm water; *Applying your favorite shave cream or oil; *Removing the bulk of the hair with electric clippers.\n4. Using clippers and razors\nIf you\u2019re going beyond the short buzz cut and removing hair entirely, be sure to use a sharp, new razor to remove the remaining stubble. It should go without saying, but when it\u2019s time to cut, remember to cut along the grain of the hair. This means moving from top to bottom, following the natural direction of the hair.\nGoing against the grain can pull hair in unnatural directions and can actually rip it right out of the scalp. You might be going bald, but you don\u2019t want to irritate the skin around existing hair follicles.\nIf the head in question has much thicker or longer hair on the sides than is suitable for a razor, use a set of electric clippers to remove a bulk of the hair first before whipping out the razors.\nRemember to take your time and to not rush the shaving process. If you\u2019re shaving someone else, remember to place your hand gently on the top of their head for stability.\nPeople tend to unknowingly crane or bend their necks while receiving haircuts. This is important to keep in mind with seniors who might have arthritis or chronic neck pain.\n5. Frame your new look\nA finely-tuned bald look has an interesting habit of accentuating your other features. Without hair, the color of your eyes, the shape of your head and the features of your face all become more prominent.\nExperiment with new clothing options you might not have considered before. Hats, turtlenecks, collars, scarves, glasses and jewelry (such as earrings and necklaces) can bring a hairless look together in interesting ways.\n6. Rock the beard\nTry going for an inverted look where a majority of your hair is along the jawline as opposed to above the eye-line. Stubble, goatees, soul patches and full-on lumberjack beards are all excellent options for the bald gentleman.\nLook to men such as Ben Bernanke, Bruce Willis, Sean Connery, Will Smith and Bryan Cranston for examples of successful combinations of cue balls with facial hair.\nThe \u201c Bald & Bearded \u201d Tumblr can give you some inspiration for your next look.\n7. Take care of your scalp\nCaring for a bald scalp is actually pretty simple, Khadavi says.\n\u201cAs long as you don\u2019t have dermatitis or dandruff, you can use plain old soap,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can also use anti-dandruff shampoo to control irritation on the scalp.\u201d\nAs you would with the rest of your body, clean your bald head regularly to keep it looking neat and fresh.\nAlso remember that your head will now be exposed to more direct sunlight. Be sure to apply sunscreen if you expect to be in direct sunlight for more than a few minutes.\nHave any other tips for looking good with little-to-no hair?

            "31": "It was November and after dating Michigan for less than four dates....I was pretty much done..I went to POF to delete my profile and sign out.completely..look up S.L. profile again which now obviously I couldnt see, pretty sure at that point he was dating someone else and hiding the fact that he was not long ago in a relationship with me. It occurred to me that I hated Facebook and him...men like him. He would say things like: \"Baby you are my person,\" \"Baby we are going to get over this together,\" \"Baby, I miss you\" Blah, Blah, Blah. Facebook now had given him another excuse to ditch me and for me another reason to feel depressed. FUCK YOU FACEBOOK!!\nLadies, in my opinion and I guess I dont have much of an experience about this kind of messes but if the men that you date talk like that are probably full of bullshit and more importantly they are probably saying that to someone else. If your boyfriend is a mechanic...and your car is falling to pieces...he does not care a bit about \u00a0you! Trust me I know that for a fact sadly. And by the way DONT BUY KIAS FORTE ...more of that in another post!\nI should have listened to my mother when she said that actions speak louder than words. Even my alma mater, Fayeteville State University,\" has that slogan or motto like that for gods sakes, but me...I kept on dreaming...what we been taught....as little girls...the whole prince thing...the romantic thing...all a myth and now yes I have to confess as a wiccan I wish i didnot have to follow the Rede of non harm. I wanted at that point to humilliate him like he did when he let me in that hotel by myself with a huge bill a so called weekend vacation for both of us..I wanted to punch him.....in the nose, in the throat, and in the ...you know where cucumbers dont see the sunlight!\nMichigan and I had a great personal connection but sadly I was not attracted to him in any other way. I think him getting out of my bathroom using soap everywhere in his body...butt naked and not in the shower trying to shower himself with an inch of water...was a horrendous sight. LOL....I am pretty sure that being in love still with S.L. make matters worse. For a couple of weeks I did my routine...finally forgetting about S.L and feeling happy in the last two months. Working at a corporate job selling dreams to undergraduates...for me a way to make a paycheck at this point, but it seemed I was getting better at it. One of my bosses, Julia helped me get on a better team..she knew I \u00a0was bored. She knew I needed someone and something bigger than myself spiritually. I needed a partner.\nYou have to understand when you are or have medical background and work in high stressful situations..routine everyday tasks are insufficient for your abilities and sooner or later you feel unfullfilled and empty with no purpose...and without love...yes I like to use that word a lot...whats the point...on pretending on an existence...that is not even surviving.....I wanted to be real...I wanted it to be happy and thrive...however, being a single mother you have to hold in there. The needing of a partner for some of us is not out of desperation or neediness, is because we need someone to share a dream, a talk, a drink,,,a meal. My dream was to restart my business again..but I needed someone in my life, a partner to share the goals,dreams, and aspirations. Trying to do something new I went to a singles meet through Match.Com.\nTo my surprise, I had a blast! Mostly it was women of my age or older, and three dudes. Sorry Jason, I know you hate that word!!!!All nice people, but only one guy that seemed datable. It was almost December, and after drinking a few wines...in aspirations winery in Clearwater, Florida...my favorite turned out to be blueberry wine, I decided to schedule events every week so I could meet more people and stop thinking about the Mother$$$$@@@@fu#$er that had let me hanging once again. Maybe I was expecting too much of a relationship too soon? He sadly as most males that I have dated in the past couldnt cut it. Yes, I am picky. Yes, I have some standards...we all been desperate once in a while and made poor decisions and lowered our standards..I just did not realize that S.L. was that because sometimes lower standard males come in beautiful packages.\nIt was definetly my fault..but S.L. as I am finding out now was not for me at all. Once again I have fallen prey of the sex appeal of the alpha male and didnt bother to look further more..not about him but if that relationship will be good for me in the future...part of it of course, due to him feeding me bullshit from the beginning.\nThen it happened, I received an email on my inbox from POF....with my matches...should I dare try again? Well that day I had read a book about how cortesans used to in the 1800s provide a bit of detail and description about themselves...you know what things to say to lure men and I found extremely resamblance to the profiles in POF. So I built one...how would I describe myself...yes Mary Jane...oh Watson..looking for Spidey...and then I built a clear...positive..bright profile highligthing only those things that a man with standards will want. Not to lure men but to find a true match of my abilities and aspirations.\nTwo guys stand out and I call one of them and started to talk..after a few conversations we decided to meet. He said he could fix anything. He said he was a can do attitude kind of guy. He sounded smart. I liked his sincere and straightforward attitude...he said his nickname was FIGJAM.\nI wonder FIGJAM can you FIX broken hearts and broken spirits?\nTO BE CONTINUED.....\nPosted by\nREMEMBER WHEN....?\nMy friend Encarna one of the sweetest and most loyal people I have ever known in my life, told me years ago something that always comes to mind in certain circumstances, she said that people are worse than animals and that they forget magically everything that you have done for them, but animals always offered their love unconditionally.\nNow when she said that to me about seven years ago while both of our husbands were stationed in Aviano Air Force Base it didnt occur to me to ask her why she would say that. Sometimes we talk about the sin but not who the sinner is my grandmother Carmen will say. Today that thought came to mind when two of my dearest friends back home were caught making fun of the way my life is here in the USA.\u00a0\nSo my answer is this: Remember when all the kids in the neighboorhood were bullying you because you were different and I was right there defending you and getting into fights for you? More than once I went home with a black eye because of you. Remember when you were doing cocaine, and extasy and you couldnt get off it..and I went and put you under the cold shower and made you puke before you OD? I was there. Remember when you lost your child and I tried to come to Spain to give you money and get a lawyer so we could help you find him? I was there. Remember when you came to Florida to visit and even though I was broke I offered you my best bedroom, rent you a car for you and your friend and feed you, clothed you and drive you around so you could have fun and learned the American Culture?? I was there.\nRemember when you got married to an immigrant from an eastern country and everyone did not approve and said things that were mean, misleading and cruel about you and her and I defended you and supported you with your decision? I was there. Remember when mom and dad were always fighting over stupid shit and I changed your diapers, cleaned you, fed you and sing to you by rocking your crib every night...well this you might not remember, but I was there.\nWhen you needed someone to teach you to ride a bike or you scraped your knee and mom was so depressed she couldnt get off the bed and dad was having the time of his life living his life, I was there. When you decided to escape school and go play I was there to pick you up and put you back to school so you wouldnt get in trouble..I was there.\nRemember when dad gave you this big job and was not given that chance because I was a girl and you ended up working for one of the most successful companies in the world? I was not there...I was bartending so we could eat...I was selling shoes and clothes to pay for my books so I could go to school...I was already a grownup once you were born. Remember when we moved to a new apartment and you were too little to help carrying furniture out of the truck..I was eleven...I was little too...but I was there for you.\nRemember when you were heartbroken and were getting everyone's help financially and given chances like going to barber school or cooking school. I was not there, I was in the USA...heartbroken and broke donating blood and homeless and when you called me and you said: I need you....I went and help you out with words and with financial help.\nSo I asked both of you....last week why were not for me when I have always been for you. Love you guys. Mystique James.\nPosted by\nA life of a person is composed of moments and memories and I wonder if when I am not longer here some stranger will read my blog 50 years from now and find it amusing, silly, or completely stupid. When I started this blog about a year and a half ago my main aim was to inspire women everywhere to vent about their relationships, their stupid boyfriends that had either broken their hearts or simply were pieces of shit like mine was.\nBut now I see that my awful writing is more of a journal, kind of a survival experience and that this is hell much cheaper than psychotherapy. Every other week, I tell myself I WILL NOT succumb any more to this pointless dating strangers...learning their habits and tells...yes each one of them have one or more than one as I guess I have mine, but every week or every other week I talk with these strangers.\nSometimes a few line of texting..nothing much...it gets nowhere...as I am becoming much better on my screening and elimination process. I mean...dont have a job...? dont have a car?? what you dont have a license?...DUI? Felony? automatic NO..NOS. BUT then \u00a0you also meet and talk with people on the phone that are nice...decent guys out there...but when you meet them...well lets say that EPIC failure. In the last three weeks I have had five or six dates...only repeated with one guy which seems might have some future..but now all of them I compared to him. I even stopped dating for a couple weeks as it seemed unfair to me to have dates with people that I could never find anything good as I was still in love with him. How odd!\nAnd then, I remember the things he said like: I am just coming over because you live fifteen miles the right way...how lucky for me to live fifteen miles the right way. I wonder if he knew how much it meant to me the last time I saw him.. He said I looked great, that I was gorgeous...and beautiful...never to be seen again. I dont try to contact him anymore since I have to learn to live without him.\nThe life of a single mother is odd, isnt it? I mean once you stop worrying and looking all of the sudden men start appearing and coming out of the woodwork...is crazy...and then you dont feel like being loving...why should you try again? My friend Matt told me today that sometimes you dont feel the butterflies right away...I was talking about someone I been dating for the last two weeks.\nHow is possible? With S.L.there were there the first twenty minutes and I am not talking about passion or lust...I am talking about chemistry; a twin feeling of sympathy...the ability to feel comfortable with each other right away.\nHave you guys fell in love without the butterflies? Do relationships like that have any future? I am starting to think that I might not be able to love anyone except my children. I guess my next post, I promised will not be so dark..but it is late and no one reads this anymore. I am in my apartment alone tonight my date will not be joining me tonight, but I think we do like each other enough to miss eatch other. He is 6'3, red hair, awesome physique, a gentleman, and when he mentioned if he should bring one of his bikes to pick me up...I thought not...better the track as bikes...remind me of S.L. There are two types of men in this world and you ladies are the ones that bring one or the other out.\u00a0\nI had an awful date this past Friday...it lasted 35 minutes...we met in Clearwater in Bahama Breeze and I have been talking to him for 3 weeks...nice guy...but when I met him and after giving him a hug ...I told him: I am so sorry..never done this before...but I need to go...he was like...wahttt??? You need to go now?...Me: Yeap...and then I RUN...I RUN like Julia Roberts in the run away bride. I RUN as fast as my 3 inch heel black velvet boots will carry me...it was so beautiful....outside next to the beach...the atmosphere...the couples...I looked at the stars and I wish I would have my telescope with me...I closed my eyes...letting the breeze moved my sundress......I dont want to settle...I cannot do guys with low IQ..I am sorry...I cannot do rainmen...I cannot do close talkers...I cannot do....wife cheaters....BDSM weirdos...I cannot do...control freaks....and I can not do men that tell me that the only reason to see me..is because I am 15 miles in the right direction.\nHUH...15 MILES THE RIGHT WAY I got into my silver KIA FORTE and drove like the wind....away from there....was I inheriting the same traits than my counterpart S.L? Is this what he felt that day he dissapeared when he was with me....I felt guilt....I felt stupid....He said I couldnt understand what I was feeling...on my way home I got to be honest I cried...I needed to let it go...I needed to let go of all the few, very few memories of him and learn to love someone else.\nI called my new beau...Hi, is me. Him: What are you doing? You dont sound good. I thought he sounded worried for me only two dates and he cares but once again his background he was an EMT and firefighter...a healer like me..Me: I am fine...I am home....I went on a date..like I told \u00a0you..but it was horrible...I felt terrible...I run...but I couldnt stand it...it was like making my body doing something it didnt want to do. Him: How about a rescue date...He came.for me..it was a rescue mission...15 MILES in the right direction......it will continue.\nPosted by\nJET-PUFFED\nSo here I am inside my new apartment which is still bare since I have not been able to get all my stuff out of storage yet. Go through the closet, damn, I was doing so well! Lost another five pounds. When I was younger and going through a crisis I would always loose weight but now...the other way around gained some weight and now I am looking at the marshmallow jet puffed white clouds and some mustard pretzels. No damn it stay away!\nI am without my kids tonight and just got home after a grueling day at the office, love the job, but long hours today trying to make my sales quota for the month. My boss is the best, but I do miss teaching and working at the hospital..helping people directly.\nChristmas is around the corner and everyone seems to have it all together, their husbands putting up the Christmas lights. At work we have this big Christmas party.\nFree food, free drinks,..beautiful music...beautiful night all around our company will be throwing us a Christmas ball and I have decided to go...even if it is by myself. I could have a date for the party, but I wanted to take someone meaningful with me..so yeah long ranger yours truly. I wonder if I will be able to afford a tree and Christmas this year after the Thanksgiving expenditures and my son's Eriks' bday. Life in the USA is getting expensive.\nI was doing fine until today, until I was driving back home, Adele's song, \"Hello\" was playing on 93.3 FM and I told myself not to be consciously hearing as I heard that song like a million times this week before work, during work on the speakers, and after work while driving home in my Kia Forte which by the way seems to be falling into pieces.\nAgain thinking of S.L. What a strange hold he has over me. He is gone for good now, and I have been going on other dates for the last month..some good...some not so good...but none with a real connection until last weekend. I think I told myself so much I was in love with him...funny he got scared when I said that...I just blurted out...tell you the truth back then..I didnt really meant it...but then...after a few weeks...I did..but I couldnt say it...how strange love is...all these rules and regulations about how to love and talk...etiquette which makes no sense...at least not to me. People never said what they mean..they are so afraid of everything...\nAm I in love? Not sure, but sure feels like it. I went on a date a couple of weeks ago with someone I thought was different, stable, wanted the same things I wanted seemed to like me. I really felt that this new stranger will be the new man in my life calling chemistry? He was a proper gentleman all the way throughout the date and asked me to see me again. I got excited to the possibility that I found someone that not only will compliment my life, but someone better than S.L. for me.\nThen he canceled...well he didnt show not a text or a phonecall. Lame. Unexpected. You bet I was furious. I called a male friend of mine in Orlando and he said, \"that is not cool.\" The bad thing was not that he didnt show although that made me feel like shit, excuse my french..the worse thing was I think I was finally over thinking about S.L. and I..but no..is there no one for me out there. Following my mother's advice I closed my profile in all the dating websites and now all of the sudden men are asking me out more often and more in number...but now..I am not interested. If I answer to one look what happens.\nBut chickies, is not use i see a motorcycle passing by...and I think of him again...especially on the weekends when I am by myself and trying to escape loneliness I go to Largo or St Pete beaches to just do something..enjoy nature and the sun and keep my feet and soul grounded from going a bit crazy. I see a motorcycle and then I cannot focus anymore...I think where he is..who he is with...what lucky or crazy bitch is with him now riding on his bike or maybe in his bed and I well I miss him.\nNot sure if I cry for me or for him..Linda says that sometimes we get used to the pain and that is better than nothing..but I dont want to feel pain...the only time I forget is when I am at work or with my kids...but see I am a thinker...logical and this him and I did not make sense. I sure I dont sobbed or say...Why me...and all that bull...but more than one time I will wake up with tears in my eyes or while driving to work...listening to country...i changed around all the stations..even writing this blog....I think of him again. Sometimes is a tear sometimes I have to stop to drink a glass of merlot.\nThere is nothing like sitting on one of those beach restaurants looking at the sea with a beautiful breeze and sunshine while you close your eyes and drink an aged Merlot. Then everything is better or at least great for a few minutes. I feel like I am a widow, like I lost someone when it shouldnt had happened, and it happened anyways and I didnt have much choice in the matter. I try to replay the different things and scenarios...our encounters...things I texted...things I said or possibly left unsaid the last time he came to see me a month ago..maybe more and I know in my heart is not my fault..shouldnt blame myself...but I do wonder how could I have changed to be able to keep him close.\nMaybe it is because I write this blog...even though I dont say who he is. Am I obsessed with him? Dear readers and followers...I dont think so..just hurting..., but I do care for him although it seems he has moved on for good..he has chosen not to remind friends...another hurt.\nThings are coming together little by little. I am starting my online business again. My blog is finally paying off and my children seemed happy. I am just looking for a good egg...My friend in Orlando his name is Kyle..talks to me about dating there. He says, :guys want sex...and of course they go for the physical appearance first. I get it. I dont consider myself a model..but not orca fat either. Ironically..men tend to pick size 10 to 12s.\n\u00a0I really dont think that is the problem..but you know guys do want someone that is fit...is beyond me how they expect someone that is on their 40s (late forties) to have a size 0..after 3 kids...look perfect but dont wear make up...have stable jobs, a degree, a BMW...and be a personal trainer...oh wait also high sex drive....and make sure you do what I want you to do and think what I want you to think...but then they also want someone caring, honest, loyal and be able to take care of their four kids.\nWow..no realistic expectations at all. I do look physical appearance, but most of the times (there is always the crazies)..you can really see beauty on a person's soul and spirit and feel that connection. Have we become so picky that we cannot establish that connection unless these strangers we date have fulfill some stupid requirement's list? I guess so.\nAll I know is that I am not giving up on finding the right one...even if I have to kiss a few frogs..I meant if I give up...I am not giving up on finding the right one...I am giving up on believing that there is such a thing as the one...right?\nWell my search continues..thanks for sharing is 3:00 am EST and tomorrow I work. Love and Light. Mystique James.\nPosted by\n\u00a0\nOnce again on a Sunday afternoon hanging out at my favorite spot here at Barnes and Nobles in Brandon, Florida since I said NO, NO to Brighthouse extremely nefarious and high prices. I have been coming here for eight years..pretty much they should reserve a spot for me....VIP CHICK.\nHere, I stand with my new green flannel shirt and slim jeans hanging next to the Westwood Mall filled with nursing students, alone souls, and retirees...scanning yes you guess...for a soulful male of the species...I scan the coffee shop...yes a couple of good looking guys...one seems to submerged on his book looks adorable...but it seems out of it and upset about something.....other with the wife making eye contact... GOOD GOD! I am starting to believe my mother when she says that all men are cut by the same cloth. I guess there is nothing wrong with looking but the bastard looked up me like wow I love your assticle....get lost loser and put attention to your woman,,,I thought and I raised an eyebrow...damn I am starting think that loyalty and love dont exist..everyone looking for the next shiny object.\n\u00a0I wander around the isles..stopping on the pagan section...nothing new here.....I got almost every book....I fantasize about how I will meet THE ONE...and if it will ever happen like in the movies...you know like when you go to the bookstore...pick a book and someone reaches for the same book...you look into his eyes....and him in yours...and is love at first sight.\nHow lame is that? I guess some men do fantasize of the same thing...but I bet on their dreams...I am a size zero dressed as a cheerleader....but smart in a way...maybe dark black thick rim glasses and some kind of small lacey skirt....and they are there to help me or teach me a lesson..yes predictable...there is always pornhub guys...lmao. Well dont get me started I am extremely creative at coming up with borderline sexy scenarios..you catch my drift. Yes so I think S.L. is the one but he can only be the one if he is willing right? And he is obviously so busy...thinking how to get the perfect woman that he is missing me...oh shit S.L. sooner or later...this train will not be in the station ..you better get your shit straight.\n\u00a0Damn now next to me a super hotty...bold man..yes I am incorregible....this is turning into a sicknes...but you know what I am forty-four...and I want to enjoy my life...so there no need for all of you to judge me...I do enough of that myself 24/7..just looking...okay...and I am saying what all of you want to do anyways...fudge. Turn around, okay...wow he looked younger...the guy is at least 55 and with his child..still hottness but .I guess you really need to turn around the whole way...lmao..okay epic downfall that is a NOOOO. NEXTTTT!\nWondering how I am turning into a souless and on a major B lately..as the days go by...lately I sing at my apartment \"Faith Hill,\" 'Let me let go\" and \"I will\" thinking of S.L. who appeared on my life once more...but now he is more like one of those birds that fly south only when some other bitch rejects them...or maybe they come home for the summer to catch easy prey. I think he thinks I am a doormat always there when he needs me, maybe he is right...when he asks I dont have the heart to tell him no...he is such a sexy mofo..and maybe some of you readers will think the same, but I rather settle for one person that once in a while and enjoy that date random strangers that dont satisfy me in any way.\u00a0\nStill on the search? I guess S.L. rejection does not leave me much of an option...or maybe this is after school homework? For my research, I do still search on dating sites...and gosh as the days go by...I discover more and more loneliness and deceit...so I decided...to lay down for a while. POF, Okay Cupid, SingleDating, and dont get me started with ZOOK's...now working for okay cupid as a moderator I see more beef and tuna that in Publix...yuckkkk...so grosss you guys...but I worked for them they pay me a little money to go over profiles and moderate pictures and language.\u00a0\nYesterday, Halloween...again lonely all the couples making plans to get dressed up as this or that...and me missing S.L. who couldnt care less for me and possibly doing plans with his \"friend.\" I hate how people use the word \"friend' to define...I am sleeping with someone else when I am not with you, just a theory of course...it could be just a friend...wherever...at this time I ignore the hurt...and keep moving on. Just like Sara Evans says: I am getting a little stronger as time go by...I am done on how it feels... I am done with you dragging my heart around. So I decided to go dancing..my butt off...IT IS Saturday night....I am definetly not staying home....waiting for you to call..for the last three weeks I have been talking with MICHIGAN...yes you guess it..he is from MICHIGAN and coming to Tampa to live soon.\nMICHIGAN is a forty-two year old, attractive, intelligent guy...and when we talk on the phone there is such a connection...where did I find MICHIGAN...I better not say...but lets say that his ad said: WANTED GIRLFRIEND. LMAO. I can hear all of you...omg ...you are going to finish in a body bag...what the hell girl...you are crazy...you are stupid...Respectfully...I AM NOT AFRAID TO DIE AND I DONT GIVE A FUCK at this point...sorry.\nI guess the 3.00 dollar bottle of Merlot at ALDI did its work because loneliness got hold of me last past week and after searching the internet for part time jobs..I decided to answer MICHIGAN and after texting for a bit....I tell you the truth I felt lucky I answered. MICHIGAN turn out to be a business man with plenty of funds...handsome...in shape...that adores me for my mind and my looks...treats me with respect and like a queen...so MICHIGAN here I come we set up a date.\u00a0\nMICHIGAN wanted someone for a real relationship...he is not into casual dating..he is tired of social media crap...as a matter fact he does not even own a smart phone...he says: I got my laptop..which I thought was charming...He wanted someone to be his girlfriend..to have a future with someone.. .a real connection...well I am looking for the same. When we connected so well on the phone had dinner...chemistry good...and then it happen...what happened? S.L. happen...my head and heart couldnt get in agreement. This was the freaking monologue: My head: S.L. is using you..the minute he finds the perfect friend...he will completely forget that you exists...My heart (the loser): But he makes me feel different..My head: (the real loser): This guy is perfect...if he turns out to be as half handsome as his picture you will be stupid to say no. My Heart: (Okay let's give it a try).\u00a0\n\u00a0Trying to reason with your heart is like trying to reason with a five dollar hooker they just want what they want. So I went out with MICHIGAN...and who knew....actually I enjoyed myself...good dinner...good conversation..good manners...I think I met MR. GREY without the kinkiness.\nSo....since I promise not to do to others what has been done to me...I told MICHIGAN off...he was hurt...I thought you and I talked and I was what you wanted...the truth is ...I miss talking with him...and laughting with him...but my heart will not let me continue....fuck the guy is extremely perfect...he mountain bikes...beautiful body...intelligent...he is healthy...and he can follow me in the other department...or so it looks like...yes MICHIGAN and FLORIDA it seems...have the stretch of S.L. or said major canyon in between them. So once again young and confused...well not so young but definetly confused...since I know S.L. and I will never had a future at least the future that I thought we should have but while I am sure he still searching for his size zero fit girlfriend..and leaving opportunities behind...S.L...Men in general there is no such thing as perfect....sorry to let you know..if someone.that is smart..has money and her life together...then you guys want submissive...go buy a puppy...lmao .....guys are such dicks!!\n..\nThe art of seduction is all that..and art...and men dont like it when they have it easy..they are hunters by nature..What makes me beautiful is that I dont need him...and the more unaprochable I am the more I become on his eyes the best....I become what he cannot have..we always want what we cannot have right? I mean look at me I am the epiteth of that...lol\nThe truth is that I went out dancing just to get out of the house and loose some pounds...and forget about YOU. Although now after having my fourth wiskey...and feeling the same than before, obviously this is not the real stuff...thanks god is five bucks per drink...I have lost ten pounds....but I got to dance with one of the sexiest men ever!!! He made my day...you smell wonderful he said...I didnt even know his name..but KEEP IT ON GIRL..losing weight...growing my hair....is working wonders on attracting the males of the species...amazing how visual men are...within 20 minutes i was asking myself .....who was I missing and what is his name? Hmmmm...bring it on..hottie.\n\u00a0I guess I could put the excuse that is all the males of the world that keep dissapointing me, but truth is my fault for putting my heart out there. I am still a chick looking for a gooood eggg, since I dont think S.L. will ever crack it...get it? BUT unfortunately every time that I crack a new egg...turns out a freaking disaster. Too much yolk, not enough...no yolk...lmao.\u00a0\nNot to say that lately I have discovered in my self an unsatiable appetite for man that are bald...bald is the new sexy...if you dont believe me...look everywhere..more and more men are doing it. S.L. Dont forget about US...tell you the truth men out there...if this is your situation...call that girl...if not tell her the truth...I know what you are saying...some woman do the same thing and that you like to eat the cake and have it too...is that how it goes? Are we all adults...tell someone that you love that you love them...and if you dont love them please tell them...too...this goes for both sexes....so they dont have their life on hold for you....Missing you is turture when you are a true romantic...Sorry Michigan....i gave you stitches..maybe who knows....I might ...change my mind...again...I am a woman \u00a0and we are known to do that....but I am sure that you soon...if not today like most men out there..will be having candlelight dinner with a cheerleader with dark ream glasses.\nP.S.: For all my male bold man followers....you guys keep it sexy...here is a lonely chick in Tampa, Florida...a sexy red head. chickie...loookinggg for a goood eggg saying keep it cool boys! Love and Light. Mystique James.\nPosted by\nThis is for my girlies and sisters that lost somebody. Mariah Carey you always know what to say. Creation shows me what to do the music tells me what to feel and I see my present myself standing in front of my past present judging standing in front of each other like a mirror saying goodbye. \"Goodbye\" says my present self, \"break the mirror make a blank slate! Move on!\"\u00a0\nMy past self turns around and looks sad...maybe that was my ego leaving. I can see she tries to turn back like a hurt child trying to get a hold of my heart again, pouting, and it works I feel sorry for herself and for him, again...No way...not again....my ego does not feel bad not for me. \"I found someone new. With this someone I dont have to walk on eggshells all the time and he is honored to spend time with me and I with him.\"\n\u00a0I am tired of looking through a dirty windown and keep myself in check when I let HIM \u00a0set the pace? Just because I was not thinking straight...or maybe thinking in him I am a giver after all, but just like Ellie Goulding say...love me like you do....what were you waiting for? Say goodnight....and then I will know if this is right and this is real..who owns my heart now? The answer is me.\nNew beginnings are scary my faith is shaken I got keep my head held high. When you meet a new person that finally sees you for who you are..you finally feel like a human being again. Maybe it was not me.right? Dont they say that on break ups. \"Baby is not you is me?\" \u00a0Well this time I know it was not me, he avoid it me...ditch me...make me feel ashamed of being me...when all I did is to be there for him...you know the feeling and most importantly he made me feel worthless not like a lady...now I am drawing the FUcking line!!!! Am I MAD???? Hell Yeah! Hell to the Yes!!! O.K. Yes it was all my fault I allowed to happen...but dont you suppose to trust your couple that when they have your heart they will treat it right? Isnt that part of the TRUST?\nNo more come back baby please.... No more can we see each other this weekend again? Fuck NO, Now get in line!!!! It is time that you learn your place like you want me to learn mine right? Remember when you said that I needed to say what was that?...Submissive...helll NO! Stupid???? Pretend that I didnt see you text that 24 year old in Texas?.....Pretend that I knew you didnt live with a woman but with a buddy?...Pretend that you didnt move on...and were not exclusive...boy you must think that I AM A MORON!!! I pretended...pretended because I tried to give us a chance..because in all those nights we were together...I did feel your love...so bye, bye, I hope you reach a better place because I am moving on. The red dragon is coming back....I know now that you dont give a rat's butt, but I needed closure.\nI wonder who will take your place it seems that you sir are irreplaceable NOTTTT!....there are plenty of guys turning their eyes on now...better men. I know that a lot of my most relationship experience buddies will say that you cannot find yourself on another person that you need to find yourself first is not about how other person makes you feel. I get that. I really do...but most people that say that have a couple am I right? Sorry if I sound sarcastic and upset...really I am not, but i am so tired of being single and hear the little comments and looks that I know better since I have a man. Pleasseeee! Let's dont forget once upon a time I was married for 19 years...that's right Mystique James...married...the horror. I just have a question....why are woman like cows....why God didnt make us unfeeling bitches...I prayed for that so many times...Well I am fighting back!!!\u00a0\nLOVE CHICKIES GOODNIGHT FROM TAMPA, FLORIDA.\nA girl in her dreams meet a guy\nwho makes her happy n fly high\nas dream is over, he says good-bye\ngirl asked him why\nmine forever till I die\u201d\nguy answered and gave a reply\n\u201cI am just a dream so don\u2019t cry\nget back to reality and open ur eyes\u201d\n",

I look friendly during that). Thankfully no one has ever picked a fight with me out of the blue because of it, and in reality, I smile quite a lot when I talk with somebody else.\nIt's just when I commute/move/be alone, I have that kind of face and body, I guess...anyway, I don't have a tall build (5'7\") but is pretty fit. Slightly above average looks, and very dark skin.\nSo r/Askmen , what would be your advice?\ntl;dr: How to convince everyone that I'm really a friendly Alaskan Malamute when everybody thinks that I'm a Gray Wolf?\n1 year ago\nI'm 195cm in height and better part of 110 kilos in weight, I suffer from what my friends and I call \"Dredd face\", I have a constant sneer on my face for no reason other than it's how my face falls when I don't use my muscles.\nWhat I do these days is I 'smirk' with one side of my mouth and it gives just enough feeling off that I become a hell of a lot more approachable. It's hard to do all the time, but it works when you're conversing with a lot of folk in numerous social encounters.\nIt's also great for the opposite, I drop the smirk when I'm busy at work...\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\nPounds on desk\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\nLuckily enough, the smirk works because I've got quite expressive eyes.\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\nI have this same problem. I'm an introvert working an extrovert job. And i have a resting bitch face. I frequently get asked if I'm sad or mad. I get comments like \"you should smile more\" and it pisses me off.\nFor me, I've found it helps to be aware of it. And if I raise my eyebrows slightly, it changes the tone of my face enough where I don't look like I'm going to murder the next person that passes by.\n1 year ago\nI do this.\nI'm almost constantly aware of my face, my expression, how I'm holding my eyebrows, my mouth, my eyes.\nMostly because I WANT to put people at ease. My resting bitch face is mean looking. Plus I feel murderous when strangers tell me to smile more.\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n\"you should smile more\"\nOnly sane reaction is to punch them. Punch them hard and often enough they won't be able to smile anymore.\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n\"you should smile more\"\n\"Why?\" people hate having to justify their inane statements so by always calling them on it you can make them back off.\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\nIf you look unapproachable, approach people.\nIt's hard to smile constantly, but pretty natural to do so when you're initiating the approach or starting the conversation.\nI can also look pretty angry but since my face will light up when I talk to people, they immediately relax.\n1 year ago\nI guess I should do that a lot more.\n1 year ago\nMight sound silly, but try wearing glasses (reading glasses)\nI have a friend who had \"snake eyes\" (quite squinty) and he might have looked suspicious to other people.

Looks friendlier .\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\nI have a similar situation.\nAn older lady in my office always has a resting bitch face. I never spoke to her because she always looked angry.\nOne day I randomly spoke to her because I was just being polite and......she couldn't have been nicer.\nHer problem was she is incredibly shy AND has a resting bitch face.\nAnswer: smile a ton, make friendly convo as much as possible and say hello often.\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\nThankfully no one has ever picked a fight with me out of the blue because of it\nIf I can at least give you consolation on that subject, you are less likely to be picked in a fight because of it.\n1 year ago\nI'm a pseudo-extrovert (introvert at heart, but can be outgoing when in the zone)\nSo you mean you're an introvert. Being an introvert doesn't mean you can't party or be outgoing.\n1 year ago\nI can relate, I have some pretty crazy scars on my face that can make people a bit standoffish when the first see me. There is an old reddit post floating around where you can see if you're curious.\nMy biggest advice would be too smile when you see people looking at you, even if they are strangers. You'll almost always get a smile back.\n1 year ago\nAlmost impregnated by your badassery, sir!\nFace ripped off, and going all first responder on the scene of the crash. Looks like you healed well too.\n1 year ago\nPic is a candid my sister took. All Im doing is eating some dank ass shawarma yet I still look like I hate the world.\nThis semester in two of my classes I noticed a girl who had resting bitchface really bad. I made a few comments to her after class and we started talking. She turned out to be really nice and now I think shes actually kind of cute. Turns out her bitch face is just genetics (100% Russian)\nThere is nothing wrong with having a resting scowl imo. Its really just a matter of people not being friendly enough.\nWhat was that thing that someone once said about a book and its cover?\n1 year ago\nI realised I had this problem in highschool even I went to take my senior photos.

About 70% of people I encounter during that commute are just \"obstacles\" as they walk too slowly and hogs the lane. At such point in time, I would consider them as annoying...\nHmm, that might just be it...\n1 year ago\nApproached sounds weird now\n1 year ago\nFunny podcast\nPick one.\nBill burr might make an odd joke on his podcast, but it's mostly about what the life of a comedian is like. He talks about traveling a lot, interesting things that happen to him, and he answers people's questions. It's really not much different than anyone who makes decent money and travels as much as he does.\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\nSounds like you should take a walk. for leisure. and be observant of your mindset. Notice what you think about, what you feel and how you interact with the world around you. Compare that to your typical Point A to B commute. Then think about how other people look in those mindsets. you may find that your mental focus is putting you in a place that gives off that attitude. It sounds like even if you're not ready to have a tap-out bro-down your brain and physiology is putting you in that posture.\nMindfulness is a very important part of my life these days for similar reasons. its amazing how much impact self awareness and mindfulness has on the way you view the world and in turn how the world views you.\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\nAll of us Arabs suffer from resting I-will-murder-you face syndrome.\nYou cant change your face, but you can change your body language.\nTry to think of something funny/aww during commutes, you'll notice you're grinning/smiling while just looking out the window.\nTry to hum a nice tune in your head, and you might end up tapping your feet or fingers on your knee, or even slightly bobbing your head around.\nAll this stuff will signal to peeps around you that you are a happy person, and not out for blood.\nEDIT: To clarify, the smile you do when thinking \"aww\" is a genuine smile, unlike the smile that you fake, since a fake smile with our kinda face looks psychotic and makes things worse.\n1 year ago\nYour predominant psychological character tends to subconsciously manifest itself through your physical body. Meaning whilst you are socially engaging and interacting with an individual/group, your body language may reflect how genuinely nice and open you can be. But when you are commuting, you may fall into a certain 'default' mind set you may or may not be conscious of therefore is difficult to be self aware and self critical if you can't acknowledge/realise that yourself. It tends to not be something you can actively address at the given time eg. when you're commuting. Often times this psychological manifestation stems from a much more fundamental, innate place inside you. Past experiences, years of how you've dealt with personal situations, the male ego construct and how you built that around yourself from childhood until now are just a few of the many possible factors involved in your 'resting bitch face'. You can try do things to centre and ground yourself. Step outside your comfort zone and from the rigours/stressors of day to day to reconnect with your body. Getting massage, deep breathing or yoga or just even exercise in general (that's not high intensity weight training for example) are all things you can do to reconnect your mind and body. When you feel fundamentally more grounded and comfortable or dare i say it, happier, with who you are (not saying you're not already), that'll automatically show itself through your physical body into the outside world. Im not sure if i articulated what i wanted to say or if all that sounded too airy fairy.\nTl;dr if you want the outside world's perception of you to change, start with your inner self\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\nTry to smile more.\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\nMy husband has the same problem.\nHe's 6'2\" and one of very few tall guys I know that has perfect posture  (typically, tall people I've met tend to slouch unless they work in a professional field). He's trained in karate cause he felt like it was good exercise.\nMy family met him and told me, \"He carries himself like someone I wouldn't wanna fuck with... like he could easily kick my ass.\"\nPLUS he has RBF, really hard. Thick eyebrows, slanted jaw, a general annoyed, impatient looking scowl on his face.\nHe never found a cure, just a wife that likes a good warrior face.\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\nI'm pretty sure \"resting bitch face\" was originally \"asshole face\", and originally came about in response to guys who looked like the Columbine shooters. Guys who just sulked all the time, wore dark clothes, were loners, and \"had this asshole look on their face\". I could be wrong, but that's how I remember it.\nAnyways, your face tends to reflect your emotion, so if your pissed or depressed all the time, then you're going to look it.\nIf you're not in a particularly shitty mood 24/7, then your normal face probably looks fine. Some people seem to think that if you don't have a big stupid smile constantly plastered across your face that you must be mad or sad or whatever. I wouldn't worry too much about it honestly. It's not like you're in high school wearing a black trench-coat everywhere.\n1 year ago\nI have the same problem.  I get asked often at work whats wrong, or if I'm mad about something, when in reality I am in a great mood.\nI try to be overtly nice and smile as much as possible when I am thinking about it.  Being a trial prosecutor I think I have been able to notice it much more because you're always paying attention to your facial expressions and mannerisms.\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\nI definitely developed resting murder face in high school. It was kind of a defense mechanism really. People didn't mess with the kid that look like he was about to punch their teeth in if they looked at him wrong. Still do it today.\nMost of the time I don't care about being approachable. I don't really like interacting with strangers. If I need to, I just remember to smile or change my facial expression, seems to work.\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\nJust go with it. At 5'7\" you have bigger problems than rolling around looking like Putin. You can't make a bulldog look like a poodle.\nI'm taller than you and I have facial scars. There is no way to mitigate that. I went the shave your head and grow a goatee route. Just dive in. Youre short so rock those biceps up a little more.\nTL;DR Go with it.\n1 year ago\nA mate has said exactly the same about me and I'm also the same height as you.\nI generally make an effort to smile and say hello if I make eye contact with anyone which helps.\nOtherwise, I'm not too fussed as it's not like I'm going to stop and talk to all the strangers walking past me.\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\nWhat I do is dress in a clown suit and drive a white van to let the women know I'm great with the kiddos. Most of my time is spent training my face to look like lelenny face, so that women know I'm great in bed.\nNo really I don't have to worry about this at all as I lucked out and found a woman who was just like me.\n1 year ago\nAre you me? I get asked if I'm upset from time to time, and people have told me I look intimidating. I'm alright it with due to some of the environments I've had to live in, but now that I have a white collar job in a nice, safe town, it is a little annoying.\nAs for with women, you gotta approach them. Once you do, some of that \"intimidation\" factor breaks away.\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\nGo a day while continuously keeping your eyebrows up and your eyes open a little more cheerfully than usual and it'll stick. You'll be amazed how people react to you.\nDon't look crazy while you do it though. Just make an effort to keep those eyebrows from getting furrowed.\n1 year ago\nI've trained myself to smile at people when they make eye contact, or to wear a low-level smile when I need to be out in public and interacting with people or when I've worked register or front desk jobs.\nApparently smiling makes a guy less attractive to women, though, so I don't know how the fuck we're supposed to negotiate that catch-22.\nSince I'm bigger than a lot of people, I've also made a habit of doing a Canadian impression and saying \"excuse me,\" and \"sorry\" a lot when I have to move around people or they bump into me to put them at ease that I won't try to eat them.\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\nI'm in sales.  Practice smiling in the mirror a few minutes a day.  In the morning when you're doing your hair or something. It sounds silly but it will help a lot.  Your \"natural\" face should be a slight smiles - not a creepy grin, not overly enthusiastic, but just a pleasant look.\nThe other think you can do is make the rest of your body more open.  When you sit down don't cross your legs, when you stand don't cross your arms or put your hands in your pockets.  If you HAVE to do something with your hand do the \"finger church\" (not sure what else to call it, put your finger tips together and touch your palms in front of you).\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\nIt really makes a massive difference.\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\nChin up. Shoulders back. Smile on.\nI'm a big scary dude. 6-3, 240lbs, bald head, and long beard. My relaxed face looks menacing so I try to be conscious and smile at everyone I pass.\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\nI also suffer from a RBF as a dude. Mine comes back when I'm listening intently which really irritates me. People sometimes stop in the middle of stories start sputtering or get nervous, and ask me, \"What's wrong?\" It is only then I realize I'm staring them down like I'm about to attack.\nI have found leaning back, and putting a hand in my pocket really helps. Not standing directly in front of people is also helpful. Pivot your body just slightly so that your bodies are not totally parallel. You can increase their comfort by reducing your own intrusive nature.\nI don't try to actually alter my face though. My face is my face. I'm not going to fake every facial expression for everyone else's benefit. If you're quick with a smile anyway: flash a neutral smile at people with some brief eye contact to reduce the \"wolf\" vibe. Just enough eye contact to see what their eye color is then break off.\n1 year ago\nI've found that humans tend to this thing where they move their mouth flaps to expose their oral bones. Doing so seems to indicate a friendly, approachable demeanor.\nI've found that humans who have a high number of other humans in their company do this mouth flap thing when ever they make eye contact with another human.\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\nIf you want to seem more approachable, practice smiling. It's so closely related to muscle memory that making a conscious effort to smile will actually improve your mood, which makes you smile more, which improves your mood more. It's a win-win, and a reflex to be trained like any other. You can hone a grin or smirk just like you can do curls. It's easier if you put a mirror on your desk at home or at work and occasionally glance at it.\nAs for addressing \"resting bitch face,\" that's not something you can do much about. For one thing, a pouty/angry man doesn't look \"bitchy,\" he just looks like an asshole. RBF describes women with this problem, whereas resting asshole face (RAF) is the male equivalent. Second, if your neutral/stoic face comes off as angry to people, then fuck 'em. That's what you look like when you aren't emoting. They can deal with it.\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\n1 year ago\nREDDIT and the ALIEN Logo are registered trademarks of reddit inc.\n",

We're opening up the files and doling out some stuff you're going to find ... well ... unbelievable.\nBut believe it. It's all true.\nWith Clark starting off the week revealing Dave Grohl of Foo Fighters is an Unbelievable operative and Jeff following up with his tale about MyMy* today's conclusion is no coincidence it's open house day here. And let me tell you, folks: You best grab a seat and pay attention. The revelations herein are not only going to confound and amaze you, they're going to grow in fantastickness as each new offering gets put out there.\nReady? Here we go.\nOperatives. The Unbelievables would be hard pressed to function without them. Oh ... we're more than capable of doing it all ourselves -- the crime fighting, the parties, the social responsibilities, the macrame classes -- but why put ourselves through all that huffing and puffing when we have willing cronies to assist us? We like to take a break or three just the same as the other guy. And let's face it: You're not going to find a better gaggle of monikers anywhere out there than right here, let me tell you.\nHokay, no more monkeying around ... here we go.\n\u00a0\nTom Cruise.\nNow, you wouldn't think the handsome, outspoken Mr. Cruise would even have time for The Unbelievables with all the films and appearances and whatnot he seems to constantly be engaged in. But he digs the line of work we're in. All that showbiz stuff is make believe; the kind of crime fighting we offer is very attractive to him. It's little wonder he enjoys the challenges we throw his way.\nWarren Buffet.\nYou'd think this guy is nothing but a stodgy old number cruncher ... but where do you think The Unbelievables acquired much of our financial know how? Duh ...\nJane Goodall. You wouldn't think there's much monitoring in the jungle deep of Africa. There is. (But not too much.) That's where Jane comes in. She's savvy, completely unsuspecting to any foreign ne'er-do-wells and her accent beguiles anyone she comes into contact with. We're lucky to have her on our side. (Bonus: Monkeys and apes!)\nTom Brokaw. Wow ... really?!? Yes, really. And you thought he was retired. (He is ... just from reporting national news.) Not only is Tom fast-thinking and worldly, man ... does the dude have outside connections that come in handy. We love Tom!\nSee? I told you we had a bevy of operatives at our disposal.\nWhat? More? You want to know more, being it's Open House Day? Wow ... you guys are demanding.\n\u00a0\nHere's one you'd never suspect we're buddy-buddy with: Crispin Glover.  And yes ... he's a strange bird. You'd never know it but the guy is  eager as a beaver to get his hands dirty and place himself right in the  middle of tense situations for our benefit. (And the benefit of the  public at large, too.) He's a loon, but we love the guy.\nSpeaking  of loony, a gentleman who recently retired from the airwaves is  continually calling us and asking if we have anything for him to do.  Seems as if working five days a week on his own show for years and years  and then going cold turkey doesn't quite sit well when you're used to  being on top of everything. Of course, we're talking David Letterman. Dave's an outstanding \"behind the scenes\" guy, running down leads and hunches and more.\u00a0\nReady for a bombshell? Who's Dave without his \"partner\" Oprah at his side? Oprah doesn't do much but keep Dave entertained, but she's good in pinch when we need to acquire some pricey weaponry or if we have high-profile hurdles needing circumvention.\nSo ... one more for you and then we'll need to close the door on this year's open house.\nOur piece de resistance Unbeliveable operative is none other than ... Burt Reynolds.\nIn his late 70s? Washed up? Hardly. Burt's still a powerhouse of energy. (Which is good for him because Clark likes to try out new Unbelieva-Fu\u00ae moves on him.) We even have him conduct some of our Unbelievanars on occasion ... in costume, that is. We don't want any participants getting all swoony or glassy-eyed at the sight of him. Think about it: If you were at one of our sessions you'd have a difficult time controlling the stars in your eyes with Burt at the head of the class pontificating on Unbelieva-Zen or some such. Am I right?\nI thought so.\nThat's it, folks. Maybe later we'll delve into the secret files and pull out a case or two featuring the above mentioned for your enjoyment ... and to show you they're really worth their weight in gold, not just flashy eye candy.\n... though, it's a little rough picturing Crispin Glover as eye candy, if you know what I mean.\n*Yet another nick name we have for Miley Cyrus\nPosted by\nRemember a couple years back when Miley Cyrus twerked her behind into the crotch of creepy perv Robin Thicke on live TV? Remember the fallout from that in the ensuing weeks, when every day brought with it a new photo of Miley doing something outrageous and either nearly naked and/or sticking out her tongue in a bizarre way?\nThe papers loved it. The E! Channel thrived on it. The internet was alive with swirling rumours of Miley's latest outrageous act. And then she went and did something that sent every pap and hack and Harvey Levin wannabe into meltdown.\u00a0\nShe showed up to last year's VMA's with a homeless guy as her date. No, don't worry, not an old dirt-encrusted geezer, but a young man she had met through her work with a homeless shelter.\nShe had brought him along to accept the Video Of The Year Award in her stead, to draw attention to the problems faced by homeless youth and LBGTQ persons. Pretty durn cool.\nHowever, the media chose to focus on the \"Weeeell, lookit here! Her's datin' a homeless dude!\" angle rather than the noble cause she was trying to highlight. Everyone was up in arms and most had an opinion they wanted to share. Shock! Horror! the very thought! Does he have his own cardboard box and massive bag of empty pop cans? etc.\nThat's when the Milester (as we call her) gave us a tinkle on the old dog and bone. How to convince the world that despite dressing slightly inappropriately and grinding butt-to-crotch with a 36-year-old leering ripoff merchant in a stripey suit whose dad used to play Mr. Seaver on the telly, she was genuinely trying to do good?\nWe invited her over to the Unbelievabase and, in order to make sure she was on the level and prepared to go the extra mile, we put her through her paces with a hefty dose of Unbelievinars\u2122, covering all manner of topics from \"Macrame 101\" to \"Wearing jumpsuits for fun and profit\" and everything in between. Not only that, but a few rudimentary UnbelievaFu\u2122 classes too. She was ready to become one of our network of moles, snitches and ass-kicking informants.\nSo now came the task of trying to help El Mileena* with her image problems.\nSo we and The Milereeno* put our heads together. We spitballed, tossed ideas around and even played word association. Finally one day, while lounging in the jacuzzi with Venus de Miley* after a particularly gruelling session of Greco-Roman MahJongg, Michael shouted excitedly.\n\"Eureka!!\" he exclaimed. \"By Jingo!! Great Scott! etc., etc.\"\nWe asked Michael for his idea, and by golly, it was good. A little rough around the edges (like Michael himself) but with a few tweaks here and there, we knew it was gonna work.\nWith our help, she set up the Happy Hippie Foundation, a charity which helps\u00a0rally young people to fight injustice facing homeless youth, LGBTQ youth and other vulnerable populations. It's a pretty sweet deal.\nYou can read more about it right here - happyhippies.org\nAnd of course, because it was so markedly different from what had gone before, the world sat up and took notice.\nAnd hey, guess what? Miley-Molly-Mandy* is hosting this year's VMA's. We like to think that we have more than a little to do with that.\nYou see, we knew that underneath all that outrageous behaviour and tongue-displaying, Miley is a caring person. But she had no direction. She had good intentions, but no idea of where to push and pull. It was your very own Unbelievables that, ahem, licked her into shape.\nKeep up the good work, Miley O'Shea.* Oh, and by the way, anytime you want to drop in for another game of Fless**, we're ready.\u00a0\n*Yet another nickname we gave her.\n** An interesting game, sort of a cross between Chess and The Highland Fling.\nPosted by\nIt's no surprise that any and everybody wants to take claim for an association with Dave Grohl. He's universally beloved by all, basically the Tom Hanks of rock and roll. It's also no surprise that he's yet another of our celebrity operatives, the first to ever take and successfully pass every single Unbelievenar.\n\"I Want You...to join The Unbelievables Celebrity Volunteer Corps!\"\n\u00a0\nAnything that disrupts the hateful actions of those misguided, too-dumb-to-actually-be-evil-but-still-a-royal-pain-in-our-collective-tuchus boobs frees us up to do important stuff. Thanks, Dave!\nOf course, he's not the only celebrity working for us. We get new recruits all the time. It's been a while since we mentioned any of the new people to join the ranks and their good works so let's ask Jeff and Michael to give us an update, shall we?\nPosted by\nMichael's reluctance to use the word Xylophone in the Unbelievables' coded phonetic alphabet stems from childhood trauma. Firstly, there was the doorbell that his mother had installed when he was but a tot.\u00a0She was so incredibly security-conscious that she insisted that in order to enter the house, everyone had to play the 'Tune Of The Day', and play it correctly, otherwise she would not let them in.\u00a0\nThis was the time she stranded her neighbor Joanie with her two kids outside for an hour trying to successfully play Stevie Wonder's \"Living For The City\". All Joanie wanted was to borrow a cup of sugar.\nShe had a whiteboard installed in the kitchen upon which she would write the title of the 'Tune Of The Day' so that little Mikey would trot downstairs for brekky and would read those day's instructions while eating his scrambled eggs. The range was wide and varied - anything from \"Ode To Joy\" to \"I Wanna Hold Your Hand\" and everything in between.\nAs if this was not bad enough, she then hired beady-eyed astronomer and xylophone whiz Sir Patrick Moore to babysit him when she went out with the local chapter of the Ladies' Drum'n'Bass League. Sir Patrick always brought his xylophone or vibes with him when he came over and played them incessantly, further traumatising poor Michael.\nEven the sound of wooden or metallic bars being struck in any way similar to a xylophone sends Michael into a frenzy. Here is a couple of his least favourite tunes.\u00a0\nWe, naturally, don't give them house room.\nHave a great weekend!\n\"R\"\nI think Michael is talking about a certain vernacular we employ among ourselves, a code language if you will. He might be talking about something else. He confuses me frequently. But no, I'm pretty sure he means this, what I've written about down below.\nYou're probably already familiar with the military's use of positions on a clock's face to indicate something's location relative to a certain point. \"Enemy fighters coming in at six o'clock!\", for example, is something you might exclaim to your buddies if you were a combat pilot and you were suddenly under attack from behind. Or if you were the most despised practical joker in your squadron.\nNo, it doesn't mean you have a couple of hours to tidy up. It means THEY'RE RIGHT BEHIND YOU!\nSince just about everybody knows that, it doesn't make sense for us to use it, at least not if we're trying to keep things to ourselves. So we might use a phrase like \"Golden stems correct\" which sounds like nonsense. But \"golden\" is another word for \"yellow\" or \"blonde\", \"stems\" is slang for legs\" and \"correct\" is also a way of saying \"right\". So if I were to say to Jeff, \"Golden stems correct\", it means if he were to look to his right, he might see this:\nAlthough, he probably would've spotted this on his own\nI can tell you that we also use our own version of the phonetic alphabet, which is similar to that used by the military (Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, etc.). We change it frequently so bad guys can't get a handle on us and what we're talking about but here's a recent version...\nA = Alfie (We're big fans of Michael Caine)\nB = Butt (as in Kick)\nC = Chateau\nF = Flambe\nG = Gordy (as in Berry. Or \"Gordie\" as in Howe)\nH = Haberdasher\nJ = Julie (as in Newmar)\nK = Kick (as in Butt)\nL = Louise (as in Tina)\nM = Manon (as in Rheaume)\nN = Nancy (as in Sinatra)\nO = Onassis (as in Jackie)\nP = Perignon (as in Dom)\nQ = Queen (as in God Save The)\nR = Raquel (as if she even needs a last name)\nS = Sauna\nU = Uvula\nV = Venus\nW = Weapons\nY = Chromosome (clever!)\nZ = Zavier (Michael insisted that we use 'Xavier' and we told him we already had an X-word)\nThis is a pretty good tool and usually serves us well. There was this one time that a bad guy was sneaking up behind Michael to hit him in the head with an actual xylophone. We tried to warn him but he refused to acknowledge \"xylophone\" as our official X-word while spelling \"xylophone\". By the time we re-spelled it with \"Zavier\", he had suffered a nasty gash that required a couple of stitches (but it did make a pretty noise). He's still kinda mad at us about that.\nPosted by\nIndependent of anything else, there are sounds.\nSounds make up the fabric of our days. The banging of door closing, the click of a lock, the running of water out a faucet.\nMore specifically, there is the distinct sound of language being spoken, shouted, whispered, conversed.\nIt's no different at The Unbelieva-Base ...\n\"Yes! Tomorrow is Whipped Potato Day !\"\n\"I'm headed out to play volleyball ...\"\n\"Without pants, right?\"\n\"Is there any other way?\"\n\"Has anyone seen that copy of Stupid, Ugly Baby Weekly ?\" I have an hankering to put out an update issue and I need a copy for reference ...\"\n\"Anyone up for a visit to Mansfield next weekend?\"\n\"That was some Elvis celebration we had. It might not be until the end of the week before we get everything cleaned up proper.\"*\nPretty bland conversation, I agree. But pop in to our headquarters at any random moment and the above could very well be mish-mashed with much stranger sounds and dialog. Stuff that may leave you scratching your head, among other things.\nYou see, crime fighting and Unbelieva-Babe hiring (and so much more) are a very vocal processes.\nClark and Jeff will regale you in the coming days.\nMe? I have to skeeeeeedaddle to an opening appearance and introduction of The Van Veen Va Vooms who have graciously invited me to introduce them at their new gig in Branson, Missouri.\n*This conversation happened just last night, the supposed 38th anniversary of the \"demise\" of The King.\nPosted by\nWe had to get moving quickly...\nCLARK: All right. We're going to need a canoe. They're $38 so we're each going to have to cough up about $13.\nJEFF: ...\nMICHAEL: ...\nCLARK: Okay, one of us only has to pay $12, but we can work that out later.\nJEFF: I'm trying to figure out why you think we need a canoe.\nMICHAEL: I'm trying to figure out why you think canoes only cost $38.\nCLARK: Why would any canoe ever cost more than $38?\nJEFF: There's no reason to think we need to take to the water...\nMICHAEL: Because every canoe ever costs more than $38!\nCLARK: You're out of your mind!\nJEFF: .. and we have a boat.\nMICHAEL: What do you know about canoes?\nCLARK: I bought one! And guess how much it cost? $38!\nJEFF: Actually, we have several boats.\nMICHAEL: And where is this canoe of yours? I've never seen it.\nCLARK: I don't have it anymore. It sunk the first time I took it out. But you see my point.\nRight after this exchange, Jeff answered the doorbell (installing the doorbell at our secret hideout was another one of my ideas that Jeff and Michael didn't appreciate, but this story will illustrate, once again, why my ideas are brilliant) and found a man named Melvin Movovovin turning himself in.\u00a0\nMr. Melvin Movovovin\nIt seems he was one of those people mentioned by Jeff on Monday who was a friend of a friend who had actually been one of our\u00a0Unbelieva-Fu\u00ae students. Having heard about it third-hand, he didn't realize it was something we owned the rights to, so he combined his love of cartooning with his beloved pet black cat (Miss Muffinmitts), thinking he could provide a public service and make a few bucks.\u00a0\nMrs. Myrna Movovovin (Melvin's Missus) holding Miss Muffinmitts\nHis connection to the Republican presidential candidates is that he works for all of them, functioning as their Kip the Mailboy. Being indistinguishable from each other, none of them noticed that they all employed the same man. As a result of having 12 jobs, he was making so much money that he'd forgotten about trying to get rich off his Black Cat inadvertent Unbelieva-Fu\u00ae rip-off until somebody saw this blog and tipped him off. He apologized profusely and we consider the matter closed, except Michael insists somehow that he won the canoe argument.\nAlso, Jeff wants you to know that we have some boats for sale.\nPosted by\n(Back in the day, I ... *ahem* ... \"knew\" them rather well. And trust me: They're two characters you do NOT want to get mixed up with for multiple reasons, your sanity being one of those reasons.)\nBut likely as the two were - logical considerations both - the facts we uncovered led to a much more heinous group of infiltrators.\nCads. Snake oil salesmen. Louts with ill intention. Scoundrels of such devious mind they were confident they could plot arrangements through secretive lackeys who would (supposedly) leave no paper trail as to who the real brains were in the operation.\nFortunately, The Unbelievables are far smarter than your average miscreant wishing to capitalize on our good names and our even better methodologies.\nAfter sifting through many of the obvious appellants (and hearing, once again, Clark's delusions of grandeur concerning Marianne, the Girl-In-A-Box for the umpteenth time and how he could have been really good for her and turned her from a life of crime) the logical conclusion came to us while we were taking a break watching television last week.\nThe answer was right there on the screen, these guys:\nYep, you got it. A goodly chunk of the current Republican candidates vying for POTUS.\nDamn! What a devious lot! Utilizing a strong feminine figure like The Black Cat to falsely empower other women - brilliant! Especially when everyone and his brother knows full well Republicans despise women and womens' rights! What tricksters! And hiding in plain sight and on a public forum! How cunning!\nBut ... was it one of them? All of them? Just a select few? None of the candidates were ever enrolled in any of The Unbelievables' Unbelieva-Fu\u00ae seminars; we would have recognized them at the drop of a smile. They had to have infiltrated our ranks using a foil. How did they do it?\nWe may have caught them red-handed but, as politicians, they were collectively able to talk their way their way out of any blame. (It's what politicians do, first and foremost.) Still, there were questions to be answered.\nClark provides the conclusion to the tale Friday ...\nPosted by\nMichael gives Stevie Nicks a little personal tuition.\nBut, people are people, and we are well aware of how difficult it can be to keep schtumm about something as awe-inspiring as Unbelieva-Fu\u00ae. Some people can barely contain this knowledge. They just have to tell someone.\nAnd as long as it goes no further, as long as it's just an innocent slip, there's usually no problem.\nBut when somebody tries to make money off of this knowledge, to re-sell\u00a0our secrets, well then THAT MAKES US SEE RED.\nSo when this appeared one day...\nour blood boiled. All that baloney about Jiu-Jitsu and Judo was just so much hot air. At least 10% of what you see above is Unbelieva-Fu\u00ae, pure and simple. (We're not telling which\u00a010%, though - we ain't stupid.)\u00a0\nWe had to try to find this Black Cat person, and quickly. Trouble is, even though we kept scrupulous records of previous attendees of our Unbelievinars\u00ae, not one of them answered to the name Black Cat. Obviously a disguise of some sort.\nWe had some ideas of possible previous pupils, but had no easy time of it in tracking them down.\u00a0\nCould it be Hotlegs O'Hooligan, the pride of old Peabody, Mass.?\nMarianne, the Girl-In-A-Box?\nor Helena Handbasket and Polly Gripp, two notorious brawlin' burlesquers?\nCome back on Wednesday for further info.\nPosted by\nYou may have come here Friday looking for Michael's contribution to this week's plotline, the conclusion. If you did, you were disappointed because it wasn't here. Unfortunately, Michael was unable to file his report due to getting too close to the subject matter, which is a fairly routine occupational hazard for us. Specifically, the bulb-headed boob Walter Palmer found out we were on his trail and thought he'd deal with that by trying his hand at hunting the deadliest game: Unbelievable.\nThis was obviously another huge mistake and miscalculated judgment on Palmer's part. Michael's fine (of course) but it's standard company policy to get a day off when somebody tries to kill us. Michael took his yesterday and Jeff and I forgot to cover for him.\nOops! Sorry!\nPosted by\nOn Monday, Clark was discussing the case of Walter Palmer, the lion-murdering scumbag dentist from Minnesota (if you don't know who he is, how are you even on the internet right now?) and how we Unbelievables are pitching in and helping to locate this king-sized douchenozzle. Clark wondered why this guy looked familiar, and posited the theory that we have perhaps had a previous run-in with this armpit stain of a man.\nWell, I immediately headed to the computers for a look through the files, but nope. No luck. So then I thought I'd try the fount of all human knowledge, the Interwebs.\nIn particular, the great function produced by right-clicking on an image.\nThat's right. The bottom one.\nWhen I searched for that image of Mr. I Killed A Lion, Isn't My Penis Huge? represented at the top of this page on Google, it gave me several different sizes of that same image. Then it gave me several 'visually similar' images. That's right, lots of pics of bald guys with glasses on. It wasn't much to go on, but it was a start. Trouble is, there are lots of people who look similar. On the plus side though, it allowed me to eliminate a lot of folks from our enquiries.\nHmmm.\nThere were even a few girls.\nWell, now. We may have to investigate this one a little further (Hello, ladies!!!).\nAfter much sifting, there were a few red flags. These are pending further investigation.\nLooks shifty.\n....\nI think I sense a pattern here.\nMichael will give you more info on Friday. Till then... ciao!\nPosted by\nSend us a tweet!\n",

I was really looking forward to some pure entertainment, some belly laughs and the odd wince or two. But no, that didn\u2019t happen. We didn\u2019t have any inflatable sumo wrestling. No running of the gauntlet across slippery telegraph poles, whilst Marcus and Monica fire blancmanges from cannons. And no leaping around from Gregg, dressed as the Mad Hatter, screaming through a megaphone; a role he was surely born to do. No, we didn\u2019t get any of that. Instead, we got a load of chefs cooking their hearts out and to say that I am disappointed would be an understatement.\nSo I hope that the producers are taking note here. Bring in a proper, physical knockout segment to the show for next year or I am going to pitch this brilliant idea elsewhere. Like Channel 5.\nRight, with that rant over I better plough into what was deemed to be the \u2018knockout\u2019 week on MasterChef: The Professionals. Which, OK, was still pretty damn exciting. I just wish there had been more custard , more foam and the opportunity for Mr Wallace to slip and fall on his backside. I better shut up now.\nThe final twelve\nEpisode thirteen\nFor this episode, it was the return of the twelve chefs then, who had made great strides in their respective heats. As a reminder of who actually made it through though, it might be helpful to have this brief recap of the chef\u2019s attributes:\nNick \u2013 Big and bald, a pastry chef to be trusted.\nJoey \u2013  The only woman left in the competition, with the lightest of touches.\nScott \u2013 Cheeky Cockney chef who loves a gin and tonic.\nMark \u2013 Unshaven gastropub maestro with good hair.\nJosh \u2013 Wacky, raw, tattoos and huge earlobes.\nDanilo \u2013 Quiet Italian, who pretends to not know what he\u2019s doing.\nAndi \u2013 Sensitive cook with a soul, despite looking like a henchman.\nGavin \u2013 Old warrior dog, schooled in the classics.\nMark \u2013 Beardy and serene chef, smiles too much.\nDean \u2013 Action man who takes food very personally.\nDarren \u2013 Part traditional chef, part Willy Wonka.\nBobby \u2013 Wants to be better than the best.\nAnd there we have it. To go further, our illustrious gang had to complete yet another invention test but this time, the chefs would have no access to water baths , gadgets or chemicals. Yes, no sodium alginate or calcium chloride for these guys, it was to be pure cooking all the way. Some of the ingredients on hand were duck , pork belly , quail , venison , oxtail and baby octopus , and the chefs quickly cracked on. Gregg did have to remind them constantly that time was running out, though. He shouted \u2018Come on!\u2019 so many times that I do believe he ended up passing out.\nAndi seemed surprised to make it through to the next round\nDanilo was up first and I wasn\u2019t sure by the sound of his simple wrapped sea bass with oyster water and neither was he, but Marcus was very impressed. Then along came Nick who executed his dish superbly, a vision of duck and plum with butternut puree, chou farci and a rich sauce that silenced the judges into submission. Dean did well too by combining venison with oxtail, mushrooms and beetroot , proving that he had finally \u2018grown up\u2019. Joey, with her quail faggot, confit quail egg , pork scratchings and quail tea, didn\u2019t do so well. She was pushing for it, yet ultimately her dish lacked refinement. Scott did amiably with his plate of duck with freeze dried raspberries but it also lacked vegetables. Then falling further down the ladder came Darren. His sweet Madeira and red wine sauce did not do justice to his pork fillet and pork tortellini.\nThankfully, Bobby then arrived with a trademark plate of pork belly, flavoured with galangal, lemongrass and chilli , complete with merguez sausage and a cardamom squash puree. In the wise words of Gregg it was \u2018complex but relatively simple\u2019. Unshaven Mark, who also went down the venison and oxtail route, fluffed his dish with too much beef flavour and Josh totally messed up his pudding made with pearl barley and saffron . Monica really didn\u2019t like his car crash and boy, did she show it.\nGavin delivered a great albeit safe plate of duck with fondant potato and garnish and Andi burnt the bejesus out of his pork belly, shocking and surprising our judges in the process. Then bearded Mark showed up with his work of art, again, another stab at venison and oxtail that showed Marcus he had \u2018immense skill\u2019. Immense skill eh Mark? No wonder you smile so much.\nFour chefs had to go back into the kitchen to decide which two would leave and which two would stay and to be fair, after cooking their way through the leftovers from the previous round, it was quite obvious as to who was going through. Simply put, Darren and Andi really pulled their pants and socks up, delivering excellent plates of salmon and onglet, whereas Josh and Joey were undone by an undersized steak tartare and a salad. And as the credits rolled, I whispered to myself, \u2018Why Joey? Why did you make a salad?\u2019\nThe contestants had to cook for The Law Society's most respected members\nA 'triumph', according to the judges\nEpisode fourteen\n\u2018What ya gonna do Darren?\u2019 \u2018I am going to make you the best pudding ever. A chocolate mousse, layered inside with raspberry custard and raspberry jelly. You will have kittens after eating this!\u2019 And they did. Marcus and Monica delivered kittens, right there, on the spot.\nDanny Kingston\nIn the next round, our valiant chefs had to show there was no \u2018I\u2019 in the word \u2018team\u2019 and the first five comprised of hirsute Mark, tearful Andi, startled Dean, happy Darren and feisty Nick. Their mission? To cook a three-course meal at The Law Society for a bunch of lawyers, one of whom was the President of this esteemed organisation. And it was also his birthday. So no pressure then.\nTo get through the challenge, the guys had to talk to each other and evolve. Or in other words they all had to pick their knuckles up from the ground and communicate. Not with grunts and barks. Like real, actual words. Fortunately, they got a menu together in no time at all and showed just how professional they are. Mark and Darren were in charge of starters, a crab tortellini with a crab bisque, complete with mango and radish . It sounded lovely but Marcus wanted more, so Mark made a crispbread with some aioli to accompany it and lo, Marcus saw that it was good. And he smiled. And so did the guests.\nFor mains, there was a slight wobble when Dean suddenly forgot how to count to six but with Andi by his side, they pulled it back from the brink and produced a very handsome plate of food that consisted of poached and then roasted guinea fowl breast, pressed leg, onion puree, pancetta croquette and chargrilled leeks . In the eyes of the diners and the judges it was a \u2018triumph\u2019.\nAll eyes then focused on Nick and dessert, who had been cooking on his lonesome but seemed quite at home with that. The pudding was to be a warm pistachio and polenta cake, coupled with a pistachio curd, raspberry jelly and raspberry sorbet. Mark took a bullet and stepped in to do the quenelles for the sorbet and again, everyone was in riotous applause.\nBack in the MasterChef kitchen, all five chefs became the best of enemies again, for they had ninety minutes to create one plate of outstanding food. The most bestest, amazingest, stupendousnessness plate of their entire lives. Beardy Mark was interviewed first. \u2018What ya gonna do Mark?\u2019 \u2018I am going to make lamb rack with sweetbreads , goat curd, olive crumble, courgettes and a tomato tortellini.\u2019 Mark kicked it out of the park, again.\nAndi was next. \u2018What ya gonna do Andi?\u2019 \u2018I am going to do loin of venison with fondant potatoes, butternut squash, roasted hazelnut and shallots .\u2019 There wasn\u2019t a dry eye in the house.\nNick steps up. \u2018What ya gonna do Nick?\u2019 \u2018I am making a white chocolate cheesecake, wrapped in strawberry jelly with elderflower beignets and a flipping flapjack.\u2019 Marcus and Monica were beside themselves with rapturous joy.\nDean enters the frame. \u2018What ya gonna do Dean?\u2019 \u2018I am cooking a pork tenderloin, wrapped in Parma ham , with vanilla parsnips and sous vide scallops, to be scorched, with a scorching gun.\u2019 Monica normally hates vanilla parsnips but at that moment in time, she loved him for it.\nFinally, Darren comes into view. \u2018What ya gonna do Darren?\u2019 \u2018I am going to make you the best pudding ever. A chocolate mousse, layered inside with raspberry custard and raspberry jelly. You will have kittens after eating this!\u2019 And they did. Marcus and Monica delivered kittens, right there, on the spot.\nAt the end, it was no wonder that all five chefs had to go through to the semi-final. Apologies in advance if you have spotted a certain facetiousness creeping towards the end there; but it really was the most successful of cooking rounds in the history of MasterChef.\nNick's white chocolate cheesecake went down a treat\nMark had yet another impressive round\nEpisode fifteen\nCompared to the previous episode, I felt quite sorry for the next five chefs in this one as they were really done up like a kipper with their challenge of cooking at Lords\u2019 cricket ground. Not only did they have to contend with racing between two kitchens at either end of the stadium, they had to deliver food to a bunch of sportsmen and professionals well known for the dark art of \u2018sledging\u2019, which really wasn\u2019t fair play. But that\u2019s the way the cookie crumbles I suppose.\nNot that Bobby, Gavin, Scott, Danilo and unshaven Mark didn\u2019t do a good job. They did admirably well given the circumstances. For their menu, unshaven Mark and Danilo were responsible for starters and after a little time trying to get warmed up, fleshing out ideas, they delivered six extremely attractive plates of food. Their light pickled mackerel with broad beans , pea shoots , borage and radish went down very well with Mike Gatting and co. Mike himself was very much in awe at the overall flavour of the dish, as he often finds that \u2018mackerel can be very fishy.\u2019 I mean, heaven forbid that fish should ever taste like, um...fish.\nGavin and Bobby were in charge of mains, a rustic rabbit dish based on cassoulet and almost immediately you could see a relationship form. The former assumed the role of head chef and the latter was the sous, which I think was slightly to their detriment. If Bobby had piped up and stood his ground over last minute additions from Gavin to the plate, such as an offal and a pastry parcel, their dish would have been a lot more refined. Instead it became overly complicated and beige, which was a shame.\nCarrying on with the tradition of a pastry chef working alone was Scott, who was intent on making an apple crumble that was in reality a deconstructed apple crumble and poorer for it. A mishmash of caramel panna cotta, calvados and apple granita, vanilla crumb and compressed apple, it didn\u2019t quite hit the mark for the guest. I know Mike Gatting wasn\u2019t that impressed. If only Scott had asked Danilo for his panna cotta recipe. Because he is, like, you know, Italian.\nMarcus and Monica thought Danilo's signature dish of mackerel and smoked mozzarella was genius\nThings did pick up for the signature round though. Especially Scott, who was full of beans when he introduced his take on a rack of salt marsh lamb, complete with sourdough, Caesar dressing and anchovies . Marcus and Monica had their reservations at first, but in the end they both had to admit that it was an inspired combination.\nMark (the unshaven one) also started out of the traps with confidence with his promised braised short rib and pan-fried fillet of beef , to be served with smoked bone marrow and Gentlemen\u2019s relish; a relish untested by Monica by all accounts. However, he became quite flustered as the minutes ticked by and as such, forgot to season his food properly, an element soon picked up by the judges.Best of the best Bobby had a great name for his dish: English beef by an Indian chef. And as always with his food, there was an air of the unknown. His fillet of beef and soft beef shin were presented with style and panache, as were his lentils , but the dosa he made to encase the juicy shredded meat was totally undercooked and doughy. Worse still, the spiced sauce he made to accompany the food completely obliterated the overall flavour of the dish. And it was quite sad really, to suddenly see Bobby stop smiling.\nAs one went down, so did another, in the form of grizzled veteran Gavin, who I hope doesn\u2019t mind me harking on about his age (he is still younger than me). But by his own admission, perhaps he was a dog that had ran out of tricks. His loin of lamb with breaded sweetbreads, onion puree and pistachios was more than ably cooked but as Monica put it, the dish just didn\u2019t \u2018scream out the wow factor\u2019.\nDanilo, on the other hand, definitely flew the flag of the brave and the new with his effort. Confounding and disobeying his mother\u2019s wisdom that you should never put fish and cheese together, Danilo served up mackerel done two ways. One marinated in balsamic, one blow torched fresh and finished with a smoked buffalo mozzarella fondue (along with some aubergine and tomato tortellini). It was just the experimental plate the judges were looking for. So he went through, along with a very chuffed Scott and very relieved and unshaven Mark.\nSo next week come the semi-finals, with more knockouts to come. But who will end up with egg on their face?

But Rash is more than his character\u2019s over-the-top proclivities. He\u2019s also an Academy Award winner, thanks to the screenplay for The Descendants , which Rash wrote with longtime writing partner Nat Faxon and the film\u2019s director, Alexander Payne . With two film projects alongside Faxon on the horizon\u2014the duo\u2019s co-directorial debut, The Way, Way Back, this summer and a starring vehicle for Kristen Wiig , a fellow alumnus of Los Angeles\u2019 storied Groundlings comedy troupe\u2014the actor-writer-director makes his return to Greendale when Community\u2019s third season resumes on Thursday, March 15. In anticipation of the show\u2019s return, Rash spoke to The A.V. Club about his Oscar moment, what\u2019s to come after Community\u2019s \u201clong, dark semester,\u201d and the perils of tackling the love theme from Batman Forever.\u00a0\nThe A.V. Club: It\u2019s been a good year for you: Starting with your promotion to series-regular status on Community, and now you\u2019ve won the Oscar for The Descendants. How do you follow that up?\nJim Rash: Well, I gotta get my country album out. I\u2019m gonna lay a few more tracks, and I\u2019m sure Donald [Glover] \u2019s gonna want to get involved with this. So we\u2019re very excited.\nAVC: If you were to record a country album, what would the title be?\nJR: Oh, God. Um\u2014Pancakes And Dreams. [Laughs.] I have a feeling it\u2019s just going to jump off of the shelves.\u00a0\nAVC: The way your year\u2019s going, it would have to.\nJR: Absolutely. As soon as you see my face on the cover of Pancakes And Dreams, it pretty much feels like the country album you have to own, even if you don\u2019t like country.\nAVC: The name \u201cJim Rash\u201d just screams country.\nJR: Oh my God, it screams country. Even with the fact that I grew up in North Carolina, Jim Rash just screams \u201cSouthern boy.\u201d [Laughs.]\u00a0\nI don\u2019t know what\u2019s next. Writing, I know that. Hopefully Community, come late summer. So in a way it\u2019s sort of like continuing what I\u2019m doing.\nAVC: Going back to Oscar night: You\u2019re onstage, about to accept the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay. Was it just an old improv instinct that kicked in, encouraging you to strike the Angelina Jolie pose?\nJR: You know, it\u2019s weird. Some people agree with me, understand what I\u2019m saying\u2014but as you\u2019re waiting for that moment, for that envelope to be opened, Angelina got onstage, and with her pose and stance\u2014I just thought it was fun because I thought she was owning and having fun with and rocking her outfit. When I got up there, we were proud, it was this long journey and all of a sudden your name is read and you\u2019re outside of your head, and I thought \u201cWhat a great way to just show off a proud moment\u201d\u2014with the Oscar on my leg. [Laughs.] I guess I didn\u2019t see it as mocking. [Jolie] was doing it and owning it and having fun, so I thought that would be fun to see my version of it. I wouldn\u2019t call it mocking, like everyone did. I felt bad that was the reaction. I was just having fun, so hopefully she took it all in good fun.\nAVC: Have you heard anything from the Pitt-Jolie camp?\nJR: I can\u2019t imagine. Most people I\u2019ve spoken with who have met her and him say they have a great sense of humor. All I was doing was doing my version of that proud moment, whatever it is. Doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t write her a letter. [Laughs.] Why not.\nAVC: How would that letter start?\nJR: \u201cDear Angelina. I\u2019m the bald, bespectacled guy.\u201d Probably something I would do, though, because I just want her to know what I was thinking. Neurotic.\nAVC: Is there any chance that Dean Pelton will end up in a similar dress?\nJR: Not in season three, because that\u2019s already been shot. But I don\u2019t know. That would maybe make us too meta, if our personal lives were inching their way into the world of the show. But who knows? I\u2019ve already worn more revealing dresses than that. And I\u2019ve even made a stance like that when I was in the dean\u2019s sister\u2019s Fourth of July outfit\u2014leg cocked to the side. I feel like you could even look at that Oscar pose as a nod to Dean Pelton.\u00a0\nAVC: Can you say for certain that you\u2019re the first Oscar winner to ever be discovered by the Reno Sheriff\u2019s Department with an \u201capparatus\u201d strapped to your head?\nJR: If everyone wants to apparently redress this, all they have to do is put a dildo on their head, wear skimpy outfits, and show a lot of midriff, and you too can get to the stage! [Laughs.] It is interesting. I was touched by NBC\u2019s little promo after I\u2019d won, just loving that they were promoting Community returning to the air\u2014but the fact that they were congratulating me and using that tone of like, \u201cReally! This guy did!\u201d So that was very touching. But yeah, I can\u2019t tell you that, when I was on Reno 911!, stuck inside a sex doll, I wouldn\u2019t say, \u201cOh, this is where I\u2019ll be next.\u201d\nAVC: Do you think your Oscar win gives Community any sort of extra clout for securing a fourth season?\nJR: I can\u2019t imagine. In the sense that I would never want to assume that would do it. I hope that it\u2019s renewed based on why I think it should be\u2014the merit of the show, the merit of the writing, and the amazing cast. And the fact that the fans reacted so viscerally, positively\u2014in the sense that when we were removed from the air, fans were so outspoken. And I just know that this is a show that no matter what, it would be so great to see a fourth season. If that were an ending chapter, so be it\u2014as a four-year college, sort of on that path. But I feel like it would be very presumptuous of me to say that [Laughs.] because I wrote a movie about a woman in a coma who cheated on her husband, that that would do anything.\u00a0\nAVC: This third season has been the one where Dean Pelton comes unglued\u2014\nJR: Definitely. I think the theme that was\u2014not so much presented to us but we all understood where Dan [Harmon, showrunner] and the writers were and what the third year meant to them, which was really digging deep and having the characters question something in their lives. Most of the episodes you\u2019ve seen so far and the ones to come hit that idea. Like in \u201c Documentary Filmmaking: Redux ,\u201d you understand what\u2019s at the core of the dean , and this guy who tries so hard because he wants this school to be as great as the school he went to\u2014but not realizing that it already is. That sort of lesson. Or to dig deep into Yvette [Nicole Brown] \u2019s character and some upcoming things with her. Obviously, the promos for \u201cUrban Matrimony And The Sandwich Arts\u201d show a wedding, so she\u2019s grappling with some decisions. The continued road of Joel [McHale] \u2019s character, realizing that these people are family\u2014and as resistant as he has been, he keeps being reminded this is important for his growth. Chevy [Chase]\u2019s character dealing with the death of his father. There are some great scenes, speaking for all the characters in that way.\nAVC: There\u2019s a very telling line in \u201c Studies Of Modern Movement ,\u201d when Dean Pelton and Jeff are at the mall, and the dean says to Jeff, \u201cThis is going to be fun\u2014or else.\u201d That\u2019s a good summation of the season so far.\nJR: Yeah, that blackmailing episode in particular\u2014which of course I enjoyed immensely, getting to be paired up with Joel on one of the storylines\u2014was such a fun week for us. At least for me. I can\u2019t speak for him. Maybe he was miserable. I don\u2019t think so. Maybe he was lying, but I think the singing pretty much showed us really, really enjoying each other\u2019s company.\nAVC: Does the uncut version of that \u201cKiss From A Rose\u201d video exist somewhere?\nJR: We did do the whole song. I have to imagine it\u2019s somewhere, because at one point they teased the idea of revisiting that for the episode\u2019s tag, but they did not. Because it\u2019s a long song, it\u2019s challenging\u2014Seal doesn\u2019t have the easiest range to sing in\u2014and the fact that the karaoke machine was in front of us. So you\u2019re trying to get into the song and figure out what the hell you\u2019re supposed to be singing next.\u00a0\nThe writers have achieved a way to allow the dean to be involved with the study group, which is probably not a great thing for either party. It\u2019s probably crossing some kind of line\u2014administrative/student relationships\u2014but the dean\u2019s character already crosses boundaries in so many other ways, it seems fitting that he doesn\u2019t really care. That gets addressed in some upcoming episodes, which is exciting.\nAVC: He\u2019s just following in the footsteps of other previous TV school administrators, like Principal Belding on Saved By The Bell.\u00a0\nJR: That\u2019s true. But I have a feeling that Belding would never go as far as to blackmail and then dress like one of his \u201cstudents\u201d and sing with him. [Laughs.] Well, I could see them singing together in a karaoke bar or something, with Zack and the whole gang. But I think Belding wouldn\u2019t present himself in Daisy Dukes when he meets with them at school.\nAVC: Of course, after Dean Pelton dresses like Jeff in \u201cStudies Of Modern Movement,\u201d the reverse happens: Jeff is forced to dress like the dean in \u201cDocumentary Filmmaking: Redux.\u201d\nJR: Yeah, I didn\u2019t even put that together. Maybe that\u2019s sort of his way of making them one. In the dean\u2019s mind, there\u2019s the desire to be Jeff and there\u2019s the desire to be with Jeff. But I think that proves that he really wants to be\u2014maybe it\u2019ll make them a couple. [Laughs.] Maybe have their names mixed together, like \u201cCringer.\u201d \u201cCraig\u201d and \u201cWinger\u201d put together. Or Jeg?\u00a0\nAVC: Pelter?\nJR: Yeah, Pelter. What else could we do? Or just Dean Winger! Even less creative. [Laughs.]\nAVC: Dean Winger sounds like the cool kid from a Saved By The Bell-type show.\nJR: It does! I think we\u2019ve come full-circle with that one. Or, like, the Dean Winger is a cool dean from Animal House that we didn\u2019t ever get to see.\nAVC: Speaking of the dean\u2019s desperation: When the character completely melts down like at the end of \u201cDocumentary Filmmaking: Redux\u201d or \u201c Conspiracy Theories And Interior Design ,\u201d you give him this weird, high-pitched wail. How did you arrive at that voice?\nJR: I think it came out of when we were rehearsing that particular scene in \u201cConspiracy Theories And Interior Design,\u201d because that was a relatively new third act. I can\u2019t remember what was originally happening in the third act of that episode, but the gunplay was introduced later\u2014this whole crazy double-crossing conundrum. And so when we got there to rehearse, they wanted to see it up on its feet, and I felt like I just had to go for it. This guy really feels like someone just got shot. I think it was my version of hysterics. [Laughs.] I definitely lost my voice because of that, that evening. I remember the next episode we shot has Shirley\u2019s baby shower, and if you listen, my voice is terrible in that scene. I\u2019m going \u201cHey now!\u201d and it\u2019s coming out like \u201cHey now\u201d [in a low, raspy voice]. My throat might have been bleeding that night. I definitely did some vocal damage.\u00a0\nAVC: So what comes after the \u201clong dark semester\u201d of the season three\u2019s first half? Is there light in the next batch of episode?\nJR: Well, no. John Goodman returns, keeping alive what he and I started in the first episode of the season\u2014Dean Pelton is pretty much under his thumb while trying to keep the school afloat financially. Troy continues to be sucked into Goodman\u2019s air-conditioning school\u2014we\u2019re on this sort of fun downward spiral, in a good way, toward our season finale. So I wouldn\u2019t say that we\u2019re turning around completely and that it\u2019s a better day yet. That\u2019s what we work our way toward when we get to the \u201call is lost\u201d moment for these kids\u2014and triumph hopefully.\nAVC: How would you describe the vibe on the set as season three came to an end?\nJR: When we wrapped, we didn\u2019t know the March 15 news yet\u2014we didn\u2019t know we would be returning. We always had faith in that, and NBC was very upfront and assured us along the way that we would be back, so I think that\u2019s what carried us through. But it\u2019s a bittersweet thing, because you spend a lot of time with this extended family, and then you have this considerable amount of break. You\u2019re wrapping in February and, if the fourth season happens, you come back at the end of July or August. It\u2019s a long time off, so it feels like you just went to summer camp and now your parents picked you up, and you just want to go back to camp. But the good news is that we see each other socially, which is great, and we just did PaleyFest , so there\u2019s been plenty of time to catch up. But I think the mood was, \u201cNo matter what happens, fourth season or not, I think we all know how\u201d\u2014I\u2019m looking for the word\u2014\u201cmiraculous it can be, and how rare it can be, to get more than one season,\u201d let alone get to three. And I think we\u2019re all very proud of the show that we\u2019ve done so far and hope to continue. It\u2019s an unknown right now, and that\u2019s hard when you love something so much.\u00a0\nAVC: Was there an air of relief during the PaleyFest panel, seeing as it happened after the show\u2019s return was announced?\nJR: Yes. Because it was exciting, both for us and for the fans. I mean, it was packed. All the way up to the balcony, just filled with people. It\u2019s a rabid fan base, so it was loud and fun, and we had a really great time. And for all of us to know that they get to see these upcoming episodes that we\u2019re proud of and we\u2019re able to give them little pieces and nuggets to sustain them until March 15 and beyond, that feels like a good feeling. I think it would be different to go and be like \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll be back! Don\u2019t know when, but\u2026 \u201d\u00a0\nAVC: At this point, what can that rabid fan base do to help ensure that Community comes back next fall?\nJR: A little bit of what they have been doing. I\u2019m sure NBC always had a plan in mind, but I cannot imagine they weren\u2019t tracking the reaction after we were put on hiatus\u2014from flash mobs to the goatee profile pics to people on Twitter sounding off. I think all these things aren\u2019t lost. There are a lot of shows that have been saved because the fans weighed in. Keep being vocal about the love of the show and the desire for a fourth season. You can never do not-enough. You can never not do enough. I\u2019m trying to get my double negative correct there.\u00a0\nAVC: What fan response have you appreciated the most, personally?\nJR: On the personal level, the people that follow you on Twitter are always nice to hear from. Both for the upset and the \u201cglad you\u2019re back.\u201d And just seeing these videos of these flash mobs are so touching\u2014people singing with their felt goatees. How can you not feel a little honored by that? Or touched?\nAVC: A little verklempt.\nJR: Yes. A little verklempt. I could do my hysterical cry again if I wanted to. [Laughs.]\nAVC: Beyond Community, you and your writing partner Nat Faxon just sold a script for an action-comedy with Kristen Wiig attached to star. Is she someone you knew from the Groundlings?\u00a0\nJR: Yeah, we came through the program at the same time; we performed in many main stage shows together and improv. As we like to say, we went through plenty of collections of wigs and props that both succeeded and failed. I\u2019m half and half at that. I think I was directing the show that Kristen ended up leaving to go to Saturday Night Live . Not that I had any part in her getting that. I just remember we had started the show and she got the great news and then everything took off for her from there. So it\u2019s always been a late mandate that we really wanted to write for her, work for her\u2014mainly because we\u2019re friends, but also because we just love her and her voice and all the things she can do. And how can you not want to work with your friends?\nAVC: Seems like you\u2019ve done a pretty good job of surrounding yourself with groups of collaborators that feel like family.\u00a0\nJR: Yes. Nat and I met at Groundlings, and came through the same program at the same time as Melissa McCarthy and her husband Ben Falcone. And Kristen\u2019s writing partner for Bridesmaids , Annie Mumolo, was also a Groundling. Maya Rudolph\u2014all these people, we were all performing together. So it\u2019s like any camp. Bridesmaids had so many Groundlings in it, it\u2019s that kind of thing. You just want to work with your friends.\nAVC: And then you\u2019re working on The Way, Way Back this summer?\nJR: Yes, we are. We\u2019re in the hopes of getting everything together to direct The Way, Way Back, which we wrote before The Descendants, in June and July. So far we have Allison Janney and Sam Rockwell attached, so we\u2019re still doing the casting right now, getting all the ducks in a row.\nAVC:\u00a0 How do you feel about approaching your first feature-length directorial effort?\nJR: Excited and nervous all balled up into one. Like panic attacks, waking you up in the middle of the night, going \u201cWhat the hell are we doing?\u201d [Laughs.] But I feel confident, for a variety of reasons. While we haven\u2019t directed something, I\u2019ve directed the Groundlings for years. As far as working with actors, I feel very comfortable working in that aspect of directing. And I feel like surrounding yourself with a good team\u2014and we\u2019ve met so many great, great people along our journey in that department\u2014I feel like there\u2019s no better time than the present for us to just start. And go for it. It\u2019s the same reason we started writing in the first place: to start doing something. We wrote The Way, Way Back\u2014no one asked us to. It was just written one summer. We had an idea, and we did it. And that became something we never expected, as far as getting out there, and that turned into the Descendants job. So all these things happened because we started. So I guess that\u2019s sort of our theme, you know? Let\u2019s just go. See what happens.\nAVC: You lived through the worst-case scenario for a first-time director on Community this season, so you know it can only get better.\nJR: Yes. [Laughs.] I know what not to do based on Dean Pelton\u2019s actions, but that seems very, very obvious.\nAVC: Dean Pelton is not a role model for life.\nJR: No. He is a role model for the desire to do better. He just doesn\u2019t pick the best routes to do better.\u00a0\nAVC: And that makes him a role model for comedy.\nJR: Yeah. There you go. He makes horrible decisions. Horrible.\nDon't miss a story\u2014follow The A.V.

            "57": "Saturday, January 25, 2014\n\u00a0\nAccording to a recent study the majority of Americans, 61% in fact, wear glasses or contact lenses or use reading glasses, up from 57% a decade ago. I fall into that category myself. I've worn glasses since my freshman year of high school and annually I find myself at the optometrist deciphering eye charts and determining which is clearer, 1...or 2...3..or 4?\nChart showing the ages and numbers of people wearing glasses\nIt's called a Phoropter. Seriously.\nI wear contacts most of the time, because it's far more practical at my day job to not wear glasses. I'm myopic, which means I'm near-sighted. In fact, I'm REALLY nearsighted. I'm not quite to the point where I need bifocals yet, but I do often joke that if my glasses got any thicker I could see the future.\nKids can be merciless in their teasing when it comes to wearing glasses. Sadly, this leads kids to feel like outcasts for needing vision correction, and that leads to adults who are self-conscious and uptight and vain about wearing glasses, and hence may refuse to wear them even though they need them. I've known people so vain about being seen in glasses that they didn't even own glasses to wear after they took their contacts out for the night.\nIn my own experience, I've found that women tend to be more vain about wearing glasses than men, and that's a shame...women in glasses are sexy as all get out. But I digress.\nGentlemen, glasses are no longer just a functional-but-utilitarian thing to be endured. They can make a statement and set you apart from the crowd. Say, for example, you're a prairie-dog in a cubicle farm or an office where everyone is basically wearing the same type of business attire, your options to stand out are limited. You can wear a unique and stylish ties. You can break the dreadful cycle of the white dress shirt and branch out into colors with coordinating ties. And you can have some badass glasses. Dare I even say, Dapper Specs...\nAfter awhile, these guys just become interchangeable with a tie being the only difference.\nCube Farms suck. Don't be the average prairie dog. Be YOU.\nDon't be a clone clown in a Clone Clown Suit. Be YOU.\nBE YOU. Be the Dapper Man in the Dapper Specs.\nI recently got new glasses. I found a set of frames I really liked almost a year ago, but when it came time to go ahead and get them, the shop where I saw them didn't take the new insurance from my employer, nor did they even have those frames on hand any longer. Thus started a 2-week marathon search where I went to 10 different shops and tried on nearly a hundred different sets of frames. Nothing grabbed me the same way that original set did. I knew what I wanted but had to find a way to get it instead of settling for a reasonable facsimile. I widened my search of available retailers for said frames and found a place a hundred miles away that not only carried the brand but also took my insurance. And now I have what I wanted.\nIt's okay to be daring. Try on a variety of styles, but you absolutely have to take someone with you as a second opinion, preferably a lady friend who will give you an unvarnished opinion on what you're trying on. As with most things, what YOU think looks good on you may not necessarily be true in the eyes of the those who will see you. Remember how that wisdom held true in my article on smelling good? Trust The Wingman; he knoweth of that which He speaketh.\nSome frames will look better on you (or worse) depending on your face shape. The frame shape should contrast with your face shape and the frame size should be in scale with your face size. I have a round face and find that rectangular lens shapes do best for me. I tried on a pair of round-frame glasses in a chic tortoise shell design knowing full-well that they'd look bad on me, and looked like a total imbecile in them. Round specs have that professor connotation and are a retro classic look but really, a narrower, thinner face works best for them. Actually, in my own opinion rectangular frames work for damn near everyone. But, as a general rule:\nLONG FACE- Long faces are rectangular in shape with a strong chin and defined cheekbones.\nTry: Large wide frames that extend beyond the temple with sides positioned in the middle of the frame, help add width and shorten the face.\nAvoid: Small square styles that make your face appear longer.\nround face.\nROUND FACE- Round faces generally have soft features and a rounded jaw line.\nTry: Angular frames such as rectangles, will lengthen your face, add definition and draw attention to your cheekbones.\nAvoid: Small round glasses or very large shapes that echo the shape of your face\nOVAL FACE- Oval or heart shaped faces can be soft or angular, but are generally balanced in proportion.\nTry: Rounded and square styles all suit this shape face. Slightly angular frames with a middle side position will add dynamic structure to your face.\nAvoid: Heart shaped styles that echo the shape of the jaw.\nSQUARE FACE- Square shaped faces have distinctive jawbones, full cheeks and an even jaw and chin line.\nTry: Finer shallow frames such as ovals and soft rectangular shapes will help soften your features. Choose a frame with a high side position to add length to your face.\nAvoid: Square styles and those that are wider than your face.\nApollo Sport computer glasses\nFA206 by Factory 900\nChainring frames by Oakley\nJunkyard frames by Oakley\nFrederick frames by Miyagi\nYou have several possibilities for frame materials. Metal is traditional, and offers varied colors and shades, but for really experimental colors and funkyness go with acetate (ie: plastic). Some really exotic designers even go with wood in their frames. I tried on a really neat set of titanium wire frames (literally, the temples were thin wire) that were rimless, but they looked frighteningly fragile and I occasionally fall asleep in my glasses. Acetate plastic offers vivid colors and tortoise patterns, but depending on the frame design you'll likely need to skip actual glass frames and go with polycarbonate lenses. Polycarbs are lighter and lend themselves to anti-glare and scratch resistant coatings. I haven't had glass lenses in close to 20 years.\nIn the end I went with a frame called Voyeur from Marc Ecko, in a blue/black tortoise pattern. I almost got Helix model 104's in Gunmetal. It was a pretty close decision.\nHelix 104's. I almost went with these.\nHelix 103's\n8361 frames by Manhattan\nTed Baker Eyeblast frames\nHay frames in ebony by Ted Baker. These exact frames are my glasses for the past 3 years\nMany manufacturers have a virtual try-on feature on their websites where you can upload a photo of yourself and then select different frames for the program to superimpose on it. It allows you to do some of the leg-work at your own convenience before venturing out into the shops.\nMirage frames by NoeGo.\nVega 4 frames by Parasite\nPlasma 1 frames by Parasite\nXion 2 frames by Parasite\nFrench manufacturer Parasite (and their offshoot NoeGo has a lot of really wild frames.\nThe Lindberg Spirit frames I tried on. Dapper in a minimalistic way.\nJorn frames by Lindberg.\nSo take your time, look around, and explore. There are frames of every imaginable style and in every price range. There's no need to look like every other member of the herd. Stand out at the office, stand out at your local pub, stand out at the happening night spot or dance club. Glasses aren't the end of the world; quite the opposite. Contrary to what you may have in your head negative about glasses, they can be an essential (and dapper) fashion accessory in addition to being a functional tool. See, and be seen.\nWould I steer you wrong? Never. Not the Wingman.\nWho's got your back? I do.\nPosted by\nInsert coin into slot and leave your words of adoration.\nBe You\n",

            "71": "Discover 5 Things Women Want To See you Wearing\nplus more men\u2019s style tips, tricks and shortcuts - all from the female perspective\nSubmit\nHow to choose your perfect pair of shades this summer\nShare\nI used to be the poster child for any and all trending eye wear\u2026and I mean all of them. When socialites were strutting around in the over-sized sunglasses, you bet your boots I was first in line for a pair of my own. In hindsight, those huge circular glasses didn\u2019t suit my face shape and I ended up looking more \u201cbug-eyed\u201d (as my brothers told me) than heiress-like. You can avoid this trend trap with a quick look in the mirror. How, you ask? Once you know your general face shape, you can choose shades that complement your face and accentuate your features to build a collection of stylish sunglasses.\nThe guy\u2019s guide to finding sunglasses for your *face shape:\nHeart:\nThe shape:\nYour face tapers toward a\u00a0longer, pointed chin (think inverted triangle)\nForehead and cheekbones are the widest point\nThe shades:\nSince the top half of your face is the widest point, thinner or rimless frames will\u00a0balance everything aesthetically\nGo for a pair of sunglasses\u00a0that are rounded or that angle downwards like aviators, butterfly Persol\u2019s , or a nod to the classic 60\u2019s curved frames\nShop these styles:\nThe shape:\nWidest at cheekbones with\u00a0a rounded jawline\nThe shades:\nIn a classic case of opposites attract, grab a pair of geometric glasses\u00a0that balance out your\u00a0circular shape\nRay-Ban\u2019s Original Wayfarers or any rectangular frame with hard edges are your best bets\nThe shape:\nYour face is slightly longer than it is wide with a broader\u00a0forehead that tapers to your\u00a0jaw (think upside down egg)\nCheekbones are a high and prominent feature\nThe shades:\nFrame options are seemingly endless with an oval shaped face\nSince you can wear any frame style, choose a pair\u00a0that complements the rest of your features.

If I look in the mirror and I like them then I get them.\nJared\nI really love the Clubmaster style because it\u2019s a classic look and it has nosepads!

            "81": "We don\u2019t always get to wear the glasses we want to wear. Although I love accessorizing , glasses are sometimes tricky. \u00a0I\u2019ve always loved the look of Ray Ban Wayfarers as prescription glasses but they just don\u2019t fit my on my mug. They\u2019re too damn narrow.\nIt\u2019s one of those hard facts of life. Whether you have a fat face, skinny face, low hairline, or you\u2019re bald, not all frames are going to work with your unique facial deformities. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re here to talk about today: how to choose glasses frames that will fit you best.\nWhen buying glasses, typically we have an idea of what style of frame we\u2019re looking for. Perhaps it\u2019s the Buddy Holly:\nMaybe\u00a0it\u2019s something more bookish like those of Steve Carell:\nEither way, the important part is to make sure they look like they\u2019re part of your face, not something that stands apart and grabs the attention away from your gentle features. A really interesting set of frames looks good every now and then but you don\u2019t want to overdo it.\nLike most things we talk about here, try and find something classic and flattering, frames that you\u2019ll look back on fondly in your waning years. I\u2019ve made the mistake of wearing really bold frames and it\u2019s something I won\u2019t do again.\nGlasses aren\u2019t a decision that should be made in the moment, take some time and find what works best for you. With the advent of sites like Warby Parker \u00a0you can find great frames for cheap without the fear of making a mistake. With that in mind, here are our tips on how to pick glasses frames that work for you.\nFace Shape\nThis is what I think is the most important aspect when choosing the right set of frames. Some frames are best suited for those with wider heads, and some for those with narrow heads. For instance, if you like the look of big plastic frames be sure to find a pair that isn\u2019t too wide.\nOften I see people whose frames extend beyond the sides of their head. It throws off the balance of your face. You\u2019re looking for something that resembles symmetry. This gentleman here is a good example.\nThe frames engulf his face and become the focal point, which is what you\u2019re trying to avoid. The opposite can be a problem as well. If you wear frames that are too narrow for your face you end up looking smushed and uncomfortable:\nThe key is to find something that lines up fairly evenly with your temples and cheekbones, or just inside. Take a look at how The Gos manages to make this work. It\u2019s a classic frame in tortoiseshell that is the right width for his face.\nA little trick I picked up is that many companies put measurements on the inside of the arms of their frames. You\u2019ll often see numbers to the tune of 50-18-140, or some variation of those three sets of digits. These numbers correspond to your lens measurement, bridge measurement, and temple measurement. This chart illustrates what I mean:\nMy advice is to find a few pairs that have these measurements on them, try them on to see how they fit on your face, and then use that knowledge to look at future pairs with similar measurements. Like clothes, knowing what works for your body is the best and easiest way to look good.\nAnother small bit of advice when choosing your frames: don\u2019t try to make something work that\u2019s too big vertically. You want your glasses to settle beneath your eyebrows. When they line up or go above your eyebrows it can look a little ridiculous.\nYou want your glasses to fit and be comfortable, not feel like you\u2019re wearing ski goggles.\nColours & Thickness\nI\u2019m pretty much always an advocate for things that people deem to be \u201cclassic.\u201d I think, for men especially, it\u2019s best to spend a little extra money on things and have them last a lifetime instead of investing in fast fashion.\nIt\u2019s a philosophy I don\u2019t expect everyone to agree with or adhere to, but I understand that. Unlike clothes that take on a certain patina as they age, glasses just kind of break down. While hanging on to a pair of glasses for a lifetime is a tough, if not impossible, task, the principals are the same. I pick my frames thinking that I\u2019m going to be wearing this style for a long time (if you have the funds and/or health care spending to do otherwise, I envy you).\nThis idea then necessitates that I choose something relatively understated in colour and style (quality matters, too. They\u2019re going to cost you more, but do your best to find something hand made, it makes a difference). I like tortoiseshell, black, muted browns and greens; even navy is okay in most situations. Like I said, the important thing to remember is that you want your glasses to be a part of your face, not stand apart.\nYou can apply the same line of thinking when it comes to thickness of frames. A lot of people like something thinner and lighter, a wire frame even. Those work for most people and I understand the appeal. Now, however, a lot of people are choosing to go with something big and bold and thick. Frames like these end up taking attention away from your face, which defeats the purpose.\nAgain, it all comes back to complimenting your face with colours, thickness, and shape.\nLabels\nThere are a few labels I look to when choosing my next pair of frames; ones that make a number of classic styles in muted colours.\nCurrently, I am wearing a label called Claire Goldsmith . They have a variety of classic and vintage styles and the quality is impeccable. Another label I tend to like, despite the exorbitant prices, is Tom Ford . Some of the things he does can get out of hand, but for the most part he does some great looking frames. A third would be Oliver Peoples . Another high quality, handsome set of designs coming from these guys.\nA label I mentioned above, and a very inexpensive alternative is Warby Parker. They make great styles that come in around $200 with prescription (depending on the pair, of course). They\u2019re altruistic as well, giving a pair away with every purchase made.\nTheir website is incredibly helpful giving all the measurements and showing a model wearing each pair of frames, which is actually quite rare. They also take returns if something is off or you\u2019re not happy. Honestly, a really cool company seemingly doing good things.\nSo that\u2019s our advice on how to pick glasses frames that work for you. Like picking out a suit or a new pair of jeans there\u2019s a bit of legwork involved, but that legwork will pay dividends when you know you\u2019ve made the right decision.\nAs I like to preach, stick to classics and muted tones; you don\u2019t want to look like you\u2019re wearing a Google Glass or that thing Geordi La Forge wore on Star Trek (actually, maybe that thing is awesome; impossible to say).\nFind what best suits you and what you\u2019re most comfortable in. don\u2019t hesitate to spend a few extra bucks either. A quality set of frames will be worth the extra money. Be sure to avoid anything too flashy as well because you want to people to like your glasses, but not more than they like you.\nLeave a Comment:\nMar 06, 2017\nCopyright text 2016 by Duck Soup Style.\n",

            "85": "1 / 9\nCare for Your Hair\nKeep your style neat as you get older. That mop-top from your younger days may not work anymore. If you\u2019re going bald, you have options. You can spend the cash in hopes of restoring your hair, trim it super short, or shave your head clean. A ponytail, especially if you\u2019re balding, will make you look older, not hipper. If you want to cover your grays, choose a color close to your natural shade.\nSwipe to advance\nTrim Things Up\nNothing says \u201cold man\u201d like crazy eyebrows, ear hair, and a bushy back. Have your barber tame your brows, ears, and nose hair. Or you can do it yourself with at-home trimmers. Keep your back and chest fur from peeking out of the top of your shirt by shaving, waxing, using a depilatory (a cream that removes hair), or through laser treatments.\nSwipe to advance\nShave Your Beard. Or Don\u2019t.\nMost of the time, a closely shaved man looks younger than a guy with a beard and mustache. That said, there are no rules, just keep it well-groomed. If you decide it\u2019s time to cover your gray, use a dye that\u2019s meant for men's facial hair. A solid beard tone will look fake.\nSwipe to advance\n4 / 9\nSave Face\nTo keep your skin from adding years to your looks, wear sunscreen, moisturizer, and lip balm daily. Retinoids can help you slough off old skin cells. You can find them in many over-the-counter products or get a stronger version by prescription from a dermatologist. They also stop collagen, the stuff that keeps your skin stretchy, from breaking down. This gives you a more vibrant, youthful look.\nSwipe to advance\nEase the Wrinkles\nIs it time to get a little work done? A doctor can inject something called a filler just below the surface of your skin to plump it up. Or you can try a Botox shot. It weakens muscles, which softens wrinkles. Common places to get it are on your forehead and around your eyes. Laser skin resurfacing can zap shallow to medium-deep wrinkles.\nSwipe to advance\nStick With Healthy Habits\nIf you want to look good on the outside, you gotta take care of the inside. You can\u2019t act like you did in your 20s. You know the rules: Get plenty of rest, eat right, drink water, don\u2019t smoke, leave the booze at the bar, and try to get some exercise most days.\nSwipe to advance\nFlash Those Pearly Whites\nA bright smile can make you look -- and feel -- like a million bucks. Guys who brush and floss regularly can up the wattage with a whitening toothpaste. At-home bleaching strips or trays also work. You can also go to the dentist for a treatment. For a big change -- if your choppers are stained, damaged, or crooked -- ask about \u00a0veneers. These porcelain shells cover the front side of your teeth.\nSwipe to advance\nDress the Part\nStock your closet with a few quality pieces like a good suit, a leather jacket, and dark-wash classic-fit jeans. Add some trendy items each season, but don\u2019t hang onto them after everyone else has moved on. If you can afford it, have your clothes tailored for a perfect fit. Accessories are OK, but don\u2019t overdo it with the bling. Chukka boots and wingtips are stylish, and each works well with a number of outfits.\nSwipe to advance\nFrame It Up\nMolded plastic eyeglass frames are hot right now and will help hide some of the character lines around your eyes.\u00a0A frame that sweeps upward at the temples will help give your face a visual lift. Stay away from styles with heavy lower sections or a downward curve (like aviators). They can give you a heavy or droopy look.\nSwipe to advance\nFranchomme, fashion management consultant, Attire Club, Vienna, Austria.\nMarc Glashofer, MD, The Dermatology Group, West Orange, NJ.\nAmerican Academy of Dermatology: \u201cWrinkle Remedies,\u201d \u201cCosmetic Surgery,\u201d \u201cWhat Causes Aging Skin.\u201d\nMouth Healthy: \u201cWhitening: 5 Things to Know About Getting a Brighter Smile,\u201d \u201cVeneers.\u201d\nTamara Connor, wardrobe consultant, Atlanta.\nTHIS TOOL DOES NOT PROVIDE MEDICAL ADVICE.

Well this all stems from the many different face shapes we all have. Face shapes can help determine the best hat or glasses to wear, and the same is true for facial hair and styling.\nWhat Is Your Face Shape?\nThere is a large percentage of men who have a square face shape, and it is coincidentally the most ideal and desired shape to work with. (The square face is the male counterpart to the oval face shape for women.)

            "8": "Shorn Scalps and Perceptions of Male Dominance.\n\u201cThree studies contribute to the literature on dominance and nonverbal behavior (Ellyson & Dovidio, 1985) by examining how a man\u2019s choice to shave his head influences person perception. In Study 1, men with shaved heads were rated as more dominant than similar men with full heads of hair. In Study 2, men whose hair was digitally removed were perceived as more dominant, taller, and stronger than their authentic selves. Study 3 extends these results with nonphotographic stimuli and demonstrates how men experiencing natural hair loss may improve their interpersonal standing by shaving. Theories of signaling, norm violation, and stereotypes are examined as explanations for the effect. Practical implications for men\u2019s psychological, social, and economic outlooks are also discussed.\u201d\nRelated content:\nDiscover's Newsletter\nSign up to get the latest science news delivered weekly right to your inbox!\nDiscoblog\nQuirky, funny, and surprising science news from the edge of the known universe.\nAbout ncbi rofl\nNCBI ROFL is the brainchild of two Molecular and Cell Biology graduate students at UC Berkeley and features real research articles from the PubMed database (which is housed by the National Center for Biotechnology information, aka NCBI) that they find amusing (ROFL is a commonly-used internet acronym for \"rolling on the floor, laughing\").

Do you know men who dye their hair?\u2019\nMr Sarkozy, a 58-year-old conservative, was roundly beaten by the portly Socialist, who is also 58, in last year\u2019s presidential election.\nRELATED ARTICLES\nShare\nWhen Mr Sarkozy was head of state Ms Bruni put him on a fitness programme aimed at making him leaner, fitter and younger looking.\nBefore that Mr Sarkozy, who is only 5ft 5ins, was himself mocked for being a chubby little man.\nHe continued to wear platform heels, and to surround himself with smaller men in an attempt to look taller, but lost a great deal of weight through constant work-outs and giving up chocolate.\nMr Hollande, in contrast, has failed to  lose the tubby image which has seen him nick-named Flanby, after a  custard pudding popular in France.\nHandover of power: Nicolas Sarkozy and Carla Bruni leave the Elysee Palace after Francois Hollande, pictured in the background with his partner Valerie Trierweiler, was sworn in as President\nMr Hollande has also made an effort to lose some pounds, and his hair has got noticeably darker over the last few months.\nLike Mr Sarkozy, he has a younger partner \u2013 his girlfriend is 48-year-old divorcee Valerie Trierweiler \u2013 and is only too well aware of how important it is to maintain a dynamic image.\nMr Sarkozy infamously collapsed while out jogging during his presidency, and only managed one term in office.\nHe was widely disliked by millions of voters, and within a few days of losing his presidential immunity from prosecution saw the house he shares with Ms Bruni raided by anti-corruption police.\nMr Hollande is fairing equally badly as his tax-and-spend policies create economic disaster for France.\nOpinion polls already reveal that Mr Hollande is the most unpopular president in the history of the Fifth Republic, with Mr Sarkozy a close second.\nShare or comment on this article\nMost watched News videos\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\nMore top stories\nDON'T MISS\n'Couldn't ask for a better present': Birthday girl Binky Felstead shares first glimpse of her baby daughter as she brings her home from the hospital\n'It makes you creative' Tamara Ecclestone discusses sharing her marital bed with daughter Sophia, three... as she vows to continue breastfeeding\n'I'm embracing my body and its changes': Ashley James poses in her lingerie for sizzling snap as she reveals her favourite part of her figure is her 'thigh creases'\nOlivia Newton-John's daughter Chloe Lattanzi criticised as 'unhealthy' after sharing a photo of herself looking VERY slender in a crop top Posed with a cigarette\n'You're too skinny': Megan McKenna sparks concern as she bares 'visible ribs' in bikini snap... yet devoted defenders BLAST critics for body shaming'\nShish kebab, chicken bravas with garlic aioli and calamari with seasoned rice: Why eating healthily this summer just got a WHOLE lot more fun\u00a0 SPONSORED\n'I couldn't be happier for them': Made in Chelsea's Ollie Locke swoons over new parents Binky Felstead and Josh Patterson in heartfelt Instagram post\n'The love I have for her is unconditional': Amy Childs posts sweet snap cradling daughter Polly... after confirming shock split from boyfriend Bradley Wright\nDemi Rose Mawby exhibits her eye-popping cleavage and voluptuous derriere in sexy snaps from idyllic Greek getaway Tyga's rumoured ex\u00a0\nFrom Hollyoaks to Hollywood!

CIPFA\u2019s new chief executive tells PF he intends to be a vocal presence in the ongoing debates over public sector funding and reform\nBy Mike Thatcher | 30 August 2013\nRob Whiteman likes to pump up the volume, whether it\u2019s belting out operatic arias or singing the praises of accountants. CIPFA\u2019s new chief executive tells PF he intends to be a vocal presence in the ongoing debates over public sector funding and reform.\nTHE FIRST ELECTION for the mayor of London and the Greater London Authority in 2000 was bedevilled by delays to the count. At Blackheath Concert Halls, where voting for Greenwich and Lewisham was being decided, hundreds of eager politicians were getting agitated.\nThen Lewisham council chief executive Barry Quirk had a bright idea. \u2018I asked Rob Whiteman, then our finance director, if he could fill the void. He surprised everyone by bursting into song. After 20 minutes of fabulous arias, Rob had the politicians and the counters on their feet clapping.\u2019\nThere are many similar stories of Whiteman\u2019s operatic talent, dating back to his childhood in the East End of London. As a youngster, he acted and sang in plays and musicals, and studied singing under the great Welsh baritone Ivor Evans. He seemed destined for a lifetime of working in music, but it was not to be.\nInstead, he embarked on a career in local government finance, then became a respected council chief executive and, finally, took on national roles leading the Improvement and Development Agency and the UK Border Agency.\nAs we meet at the Home Office, just ahead of him taking over from Steve Freer as CIPFA chief executive, the singing career seems a long time ago. But Whiteman is still keen to discuss the importance of \u2018voice\u2019. Only this time, it\u2019s about speaking up for CIPFA members and promoting good financial management.\n\u2018CIPFA doesn\u2019t just qualify accountants. It turns out good ones, people who can do value for money, governance and assurance. Actually, CIPFA brings business skills to the public sector. We are proud to be in the public sector, and I think we should vocalise that a bit more,\u2019 he tells me.\nIt\u2019s important that CIPFA is prepared to speak \u2018truth unto power\u2019, he suggests, even if sometimes that upsets the great and the good. \u2018We are not a think tank, we don\u2019t get involved in party politics, but we are the voice of the finance professional.\u2019\nUnder his leadership, Whiteman promises \u2018clear and timely\u2019 responses to the government\u2019s deficit reduction programme, its funding distribution and plans for public sector reform. He will tweet and blog his thoughts, he says, and not be afraid to take a firm line where necessary.\n\u2018CIPFA is a strong brand. It is an authoritative gold standard on proper financial management and governance in the public sector. CIPFA should feel confident in that position and articulate what\u2019s good and what\u2019s bad about the nature of reform.\u2019\nWhiteman certainly appreciates how to operate in difficult political circumstances. He was chief executive at the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham when the British National Party was the official opposition. And, of course, he faced criticism at the Border Agency over a backlog of immigration cases and changes to passport controls.\nThis latter period has clearly been difficult and challenging personally. Having newspaper journalists parked outside your house for the weekend can be disconcerting and upsetting, he says. Being followed by camera crews to and from select committee hearings can be awkward too.\u00a0\nBut Whiteman is a resilient character, and says that his close family \u2013 he\u2019s married and has three children in their 20s \u2013 helped him to put things into perspective. His background as a singer and actor also helped, he suggests.\n\u2018One of the things about performance is that it takes you out of your comfort zone and stretches you to do things \u2013 well, my God, that job was a real roller coaster of stretching me.\u2019\nSubsequently, the agency has been abolished and its functions split three ways and brought under direct Home Office control. Whiteman remained in Whitehall and took on the role of director general of operational systems transformation at the department.\nHe had 900 people working for him on issues such as systems development, operational policy and workforce planning, but it clearly wasn\u2019t the job he\u2019d signed up for two years earlier. However, he says he would only have moved \u00a0or the right role, and leading CIPFA certainly came into that category.\n\u2018I would apply to be chief executive of CIPFA any day of the week,\u2019 he says. \u2018There is something about CIPFA that is more than the sum of its parts. I\u2019ve always thought that CIPFA membership was the cornerstone of my career.\u2019\nSo, aside from being more vocal, what other innovations is he likely to make? He says that he doesn\u2019t plan any immediate changes, but will listen and learn before coming up with a development plan.\n\u2018This will be my fourth chief exec appointment, and what I\u2019ve learned is that you go in with an open mind. You have ideas about what you want to do, but you take the first couple of months to listen and talk to staff and stakeholders.\u2019\nHe expects to agree some targets with the CIPFA council by Christmas. \u2018It is time to move on, increase our membership and take the institute to a new place. I am hoping for stretching targets and I will give it my all to deliver.\u2019\nWhiteman believes that the time is right to encourage young people into public sector accounting. Finance careers in the private sector have lost their cachet since the banking crisis, and he believes that becoming a CIPFA trainee should be considered in the same category as teaching.\n\u2018It\u2019s hip to be an accountant at the moment. I think it\u2019s really cool to be a public sector one. We should promote the fact that working in the public sector is as cool as it gets.\u2019\nMembership growth will be organic. Merger with one of the other main accountancy bodies is not being considered, following the failed attempt in 2005 to combine with the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. \u2018There is no agenda for merger,\u2019 he says. \u2018My job is to make CIPFA a proud and thriving institute.\u2019\nDefinitely remaining, however, is global ambition \u2013 growing overseas has been a fundamental part of CIPFA\u2019s development strategy in recent years and will stay so under Whiteman. The new chief exec highlights the recent set of exams, which were held in every time zone in the world apart from Hawaii. He also expresses delight that 500 people working for the United Nations are being trained by CIPFA.\n\u2018UK public administration and transparency is a strong export brand for the UK. It is one of the things that people respect about the country. I think CIPFA can play an important role in helping that \u2013 that\u2019s good for the UK and really good for the institute.\u2019\nWhen Whiteman\u2019s strategy for the institute emerges, he will follow it through with commitment and passion. Those who know him well speak of a \u2018glass half-full person\u2019 with a \u2018can-do attitude\u2019, who is popular with his staff.\n\u2018He has huge amounts of energy and enthusiasm. He gets things done and makes things happen. He\u2019ll create an energy around the place that I think will only be to the benefit of members and students,\u2019 says Steve Bundred, the former finance director at the London Borough of Camden, where Whiteman worked for eight years.\nBundred, who later went on to become Camden\u2019s chief executive and to lead the Audit Commission, encouraged Whiteman to study for CIPFA\u2019s qualification and supervised his P3 project.\u00a0\n\u2018Given Rob\u2019s interest and talent for all things operatic, I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised when he managed to get a mention of Elizabeth Schwarzkopf into his project,\u2019 he says.\nBarry Quirk, who later recruited Whiteman to Lewisham, describes him as an \u2018absolutely brilliant guy\u2019. While at the south London borough, he introduced a number of equal opportunity measures and did much to make the accountancy profession more reflective of its local population.\n\u2018He\u2019s a real leader/manager. Rob understands the importance of doing things the right way and, crucially, he appreciates how people need to change what they are doing,\u2019 says Quirk.\nWhiteman also has the ability to get on with all types of people. He\u2019s as comfortable chatting about his family and his love for West Ham United (with a Hammers mug and iPhone cover to prove it) as he is discussing effective financial management. And, of course, the singing will always get him noticed. \u2018I occasionally sing down the corridors where I work,\u2019 he says. \u2018The staff better watch out at Robert Street when they hear this bass baritone coming.\u2019\nThis feature was first published in the September edition of Public Finance magazine\nlatest\nPF International\nYour name *\nYour email *\nCIPFA Member? *\n9\n",

Indeed, if you were a student of mine, I would flunk you for the semester, demand your expulsion and perhaps recommend your involuntary commitment to an institution.\u00a0The burden of proof is on you, not me, to demonstrate that I am not discharging my duties according to the requirements of the field.\u00a0Otherwise, through your reckless accusations and serial failure in scholarship, you\u00a0tarnish the field of bioethics, which you are not free to do.\u00a0 You are obligated to withdraw your comments immediately,\u00a0cry \u201cuncle\u201d, and declare your public admiration for my work.\nSincerely,\nDear Ethicator,\nA while back I got a spam email inviting me to be on the editorial board of a new journal.\u00a0 I had never heard of it, but I was coming up for tenure, so I said yes and added it to my CV.\nLast week, I finally got around to checking the Internet and found your \"journal.\"\u00a0 Is this some kind of joke?\u00a0 You said the journal was peer-reviewed and had the highest impact factor in its class.\u00a0 But as far as I can tell, you spend all your time insulting your brother.\u00a0 Am I supposed to have heard of this guy?\u00a0 You give out terrible advice, and you whore yourself to private industry at every opportunity.\u00a0 I am a strong advocate of civil discourse, and I am embarrassed to be associated with this.\u00a0 Plus, I have tenure now.\u00a0 So my question is: how do I get off?\nSincerely,\nRegretful\nDear Regretful,\nI'm sorry. I missed the part where you thanked me for saving your academic career. I'm sure you intended to start with that, because that's the only thing any decent person could say under these circumstances. Your name is now associated with one of the three most widely cited websites in the history of the bioethics field. You have a lifetime meal ticket that can't be revoked, as long as nobody catches you in the faculty lounge with your pants around your ankles. That's my gift to you.\u00a0You're welcome; use it well.\nHow do you get on my editorial board? It's easy: Say yes, give me your name, and \u2013 this is the hard part \u2013 shut the fuck up.\u00a0 Seriously, put a sock in it.\u00a0 Stay quiet, no matter what I say or do. Remember: this job is about loyalty, nothing more.\u00a0 It may seem unsettling at times -- in fact, there will be days when you wonder if I am a batshit crazy, self-destructive psychopath -- but you've got to remember there's a method to my madness, and if you stick with me, you'll go places.\nYou want out now?\u00a0 Look:\u00a0 What you don't realize is that you've already boarded this crazy train whether you like it or not.\u00a0 I've been writing this shit for a year and a half -- where've you been?\u00a0 Sorry, too late. Your best hope at this point is to stick it out with the man who got you here.\u00a0 And in case you didn't notice, I blog and tweet like a motherfucker.\u00a0 You want to cut me loose in public, hoss, go right ahead.\nYour loving mentor,\nTo the Editors of the Chronicle of Higher Education:\nIn his March 1 blog post on your web site, Carl Elliott makes a number of defamatory comments about \u201cInternet trolls\u201d who harass him online and are \u201coccasionally funny.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0Although he does not mention my name, it is clear to everyone that he is referring to me.\u00a0 \u00a0This characterization is malicious and false.\nAccording to Google\u2019s accepted definition, trolls are \u201cmythical, cave-dwelling beings depicted in folklore as either a giant or a dwarf, typically having a very ugly appearance.\u201d \u00a0Fact:\u00a0I am not a troll. \u00a0I am a real person, a conventionally handsome, middle-aged man of medium height and build \u2013 a far sight from being a troll.\u00a0 I live in a house, not in a cave, or under a bridge.\u00a0 That is a matter of public record, and Carl Elliott knows this.\u00a0 Any attempt characterize me as a troll is demonstrably false, malicious, and by definition, defamatory.\nEqually false and malicious is the characterization of me as \u201coccasionally funny.\u201d\u00a0 Fact:\u00a0 Among bioethicists today, I am widely recognized as one of the five funniest commentators on the Internet.\u00a0 As such, I am more than occasionally funny. This is easily measured, and again a matter of public record -- but again, Carl has simply chosen to ignore the facts.\nFinally, Carl Elliott has failed to disclose a Conflict of Interest (COI).\u00a0\u00a0 Fact:\u00a0 For the past year and a half, I have been operating the White Coat, Black Hat website , where I routinely ridicule him for stealing my ideas, failing to pay for his website, and being a bad older brother.\u00a0 I have photoshopped his picture several times, once to look like a werewolf and another time to look like Nixon .\u00a0 The characterizations obviously left him embittered, vindictive, and humorless -- Certainly in no position to render judgement on my physical appearance or my sense of humor.\nI expect the post to be removed by COB Sunday, March 4, or I will take the appropriate action.\nYours sincerely,\nThe Ethicator\n\u00a0\n",

It is a completely bland and inoffensive publication. Still, given the racial politics in America and the general dearth of big black media outlets, Essence's moves are scrutinized through a more sociopolitical lens than Glamour's would be.

But while the Democratic establishment more or less tries to make good on those promises, the Republican establishment has essentially been playing bait-and-switch for decades.

Epically bad decisions.\nEach broke the law \u2014 petty offenses, to be sure, but sufficient to attract the attention of the police.\nAnd then \u2014 tragically, stupidly, fatally, inexplicably \u2014 each fought the law.\nThe law won, of course, as it almost always does.\nAnd then\u2014tragically, stupidly, fatally, inexplicably\u2014Bob McManus kept writing:\nEric Garner was a career petty criminal who'd experienced dozens of arrests, but had learned nothing from them. He was on the street July 17, selling untaxed cigarettes one at a time \u2014 which, as inconsequential as it seems, happens to be a crime.\nYet another arrest was under way when, suddenly, Garner balked. \"This ends here,\" he shouted \u2014 as it turned out, tragically prophetic words \u2014 as he began struggling with the arresting officer.\nAgain, this was a bad decision. Garner suffered from a range of medical ailments \u2014 advanced diabetes, plus heart disease and asthma so severe that either malady might have killed him, it was said at the time.\nStill, he fought \u2014 and at one point during the struggle, a cop wrapped his arm around Garner's neck.\nAnd writing:\nFinally, there is this: There were 228,000 misdemeanor arrests in New York City in 2013, the last year for which there are audited figures, and every one of them had at least the potential to turn into an Eric Garner-like case.\nNone did.\nSo much for the \"out of control\" cop trope. So much for the notion that everyday citizens \u2014 or even criminals with the presence of mind to keep their hands to themselves \u2014 have something to fear from the NYPD.\nIn closing, McManus offers a pat explanation of Garner's death that also works a helpful meta-commentary on his own dumb op-ed:\nHe was a victim of himself.

(Marvel)\nMarvel has fired \u201cX-Men Gold\u201d artist Ardian Syaf after the controversy over the politically charged hidden messages\u00a0in the first issue.\n\u201cMarvel has terminated Ardian Syaf\u2019s contract effective immediately,\u201d the company said in a statement that also explained that Syaf\u2019s work will still be seen in \u201cX-Men Gold\u201d Nos. 2 and 3 because the next two issues of the bi-weekly series have already been shipped to the printer.\n\u201cIssues No. 4, No. 5\u00a0and No. 6 will be drawn by R. B. Silva and issues No. 7, No. 8\u00a0and No. 9 will be drawn by Ken Lashley,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cA permanent replacement artist will be assigned to \u2018X-Men Gold\u2019 in the coming weeks.\u201d\nFeaturing superheroes fighting to save humanity despite the fear and bigotry they often have to face as mutants, \u201cX-Men\u201d has always been political. But Marvel found their latest comic unexpectedly thrust in the conversation around the complicated religious and political reality of Indonesia, the world\u2019s largest Muslim-majority country.\nReaders pointed out that it seemed Syaf, an\u00a0Indonesian artist, had included some anti-Christian and anti-Semitic messaging within the pages of \u201cX-Men Gold\u201d No. 1. Others more attuned to Indonesian politics said the messages seemed to be referencing the current tensions around Jakarta Gov.\u00a0Basuki \u201cAhok\u201d Tjahaja Purnama, who is facing accusations of blasphemy against Islam and is currently up for reelection .\nElected in 2014, Purnama is the first ethnic Chinese Indonesian to be elected governor of Jakarta and the first Christian to serve in the office in 50 years. Last year, video surfaced of Purnama telling voters they were being deceived by politicians who said the Koran prohibits Muslims from voting for a non-Muslim, which led to multiple major protests .\nReaders noticed that \u201cX-Men Gold\u201d seemed to make reference to both the Koranic\u00a0passage\u00a0in question as well as the date that more than 200,000 conservative Muslims rallied in Jakarta to protest Purnama.\nThe first reference was spotted on a shirt worn by Colossus, which read \u201cQS 5:51\u201d (for Quran, Chapter 5, Verse 51 ) while the second was the number \u201c212\u201d (for Dec. 2, 2016 ) spotted above the character Kitty Pryde on a building. Readers also noted that the latter image included a jewelry store with the first three letters of \"jewelry\" placed right next to the Jewish Pryde's\u00a0head.\nWhile translations of Koran 5:51 vary, hard-line Islamists in Indonesia have reportedly used the\u00a0verse to defend their views about non-Muslims (\u201cMs. Marvel\u201d writer G. Willow Wilson has broken down the various interpretations of the verse \u00a0in response to the controversy). Syaf also reportedly shared in a Facebook post (that has since been removed) that he was inspired by the Dec. 2 protest. In\u00a0a subsequent post , Syaf revealed his \u201ccareer is over now.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nAs backlash to these revelations spread over the weekend, Marvel released a statement on Saturday explaining that it was unaware of the meaning of these references inserted into \u201cX-Men Gold\u201d and that the artwork would be removed from all upcoming versions of the issue, including the digital version and trade paperbacks.\nLatest updates\n",

He is now poised to break the record for the longest time a nominee has waited for confirmation.\nReuters reports that it took the Senate 125 days to confirm Justice Louis Brandeis back on June 1, 2016 . With Congress in recess until September 6, Garland will break that record tomorow (July 20), when his wait hits 126 days.\nBeginning on February 13, the day Scalia died from a heart attack, Republicans leaders have said they they will not hold hearings for anyone put forward by President Obama, arguing that the newly elected president should be the one to choose the new justice. During his speech announcing Garland as his nominee, Obama said that refusing to consider the candidate amounts to \u201can abdication of the Senate\u2019s Constitutional duty .\u201d As justices sit on the Court indefinitely, the choice could have a major impact on the laws that impact people of color, from reproductive rights to affirmative action .\nRelated Articles\n",

            "58": "\u00a0\n\u00a0\nChildren often ask, why are American Indians  called \"Red Men\"?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey persist: but why were they called \"Red Men\", are there really Red People?\nThe answer to that question requires a lesson in the original categories of Human Race colors, and in how Human Race works.\nOriginally there was...\nThe Red Race: as epitomized by American Indians.\nThe Yellow Race: as epitomized by the Chinese.\n\u00a0\nThe  list of people above, is in the order of the Melanin content of their skin.\nMelanin (Greek: melas, \"black, dark\") is a broad term for a group of natural pigments found in most organisms.  Melanin is produced by the oxidation of the amino acid tyrosine, followed by polymerization. The pigment is produced in a specialized group of cells known as melanocytes. In the skin, melanogenesis occurs after exposure to UV radiation, causing the skin to visibly tan. Melanin is an effective absorber of light; the pigment is able to dissipate over 99.9% of absorbed UV radiation. Because of this property, melanin is thought to protect skin cells from UVB radiation damage, reducing the risk of cancer. Furthermore, though exposure to UV radiation is associated with increased risk of malignant melanoma, a cancer of the melanocytes, studies have shown a lower incidence for skin cancer in individuals with more concentrated melanin, i.e. darker skin tone.\nTypes of melanin\n\u00a0\nClearly then, these two people have in their skin:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nConversely: these two people have in their skin, an overwhelming amount of Pheomelanin,\nand very little Eumelanin: Thus they are Albinos (OCA2 not the most extreme OCA1):\nfrom the Latin \"Albus\" meaning White.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe above people account for  Humans at the extremes of skin colors:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Chinese of today are no longer \"Yellow\".\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey are moving ever closer to the \"Full\" Albinohood of most Europeans.\nAs can be seen in these Chinese crowd photos,\ntoday's Chinese people have a  noticeable change in facial features,\nand a definite \"Pink\" tinge to their skin!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd of course, with Albinism comes the \"Self Defense\" mechanism of \"Racism\".\nThe logic to that is that though they don't want to \"Be\" Black,\nthey also don't want to have to \"Compete\" with Blacks.\nThey understand that to be a losing proposition.\nSo like the Europeans, they are building barriers of Racism\nto isolate themselves from Blacks, and the accompanying competition from Blacks.\nThe problem with that: is that both China and Europe are desperate for\nAfrican \"Raw Materials\": without which, they cannot hope to sustain themselves.\nAs of now, Africans are still too backward to understand their true position,\nbut if and when, they come to understand the outside world:\nthen we may see a completely new world-wide dynamic. One the\nlikes of which, we haven't seen since the Albinos usurped Blacks in Europe.\nAnd  though  China is becoming quite racist,\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOf course, not All Black Chinese chose to mate with Albinos.\n(Left - though this man's son did).\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo where can we go to find real Yellow people?\nPerhaps we should go to the United States, to the State of Texas:\nwhich has as it's State Song,\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOkay, we have accounted for the Black Man, the White Man, and the Yellow Man:\nthough not the ones we were expecting.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNo, they are not Indians, they are just ordinary White people with\nSunburn, Rosacea,  Make-up, or simple \"Photo-Shopping\".\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom \"Real-Life\" experience, we know that \"Dark-Brown Skinned People\"\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs we can see from these portraits of \"REAL\" Indians...\nYES!\n",

As such, only a handful of the film\u2019s stars actually made it to London for the premiere.  Basically, it was just Jeremy Irons and Paul Bettany, both of whom seem to be competing for The Fancy-Pants Prize.\nI mean\u2026 I love Paul.  I love his voice, his accent, I love his blonde-ginger (strawberry blonde?) hair, I love that he\u2019s so epically tall that he walks with a slight stoop.  I don\u2019t mind that he\u2019s pasty, and I don\u2019t mind that he takes more fashion \u201crisks\u201d than most heterosexual men.  But I\u2019m not sure if I can get on board with this look.  You know what\u2019s bothering me the most?  Everything above the neckerchief/scarf (although the scarf is whole other topic of conversation).  Is his hairline receding?  Or is it just bad lighting?  And WHY with the tinted glasses?  And why do the stubble when it\u2019s obvious that he\u2019s carefully planned this VESTY ensemble?  Just shave.  But\u2026 I don\u2019t mind the tweed.  And Paul is reminding me of someone\u2026 like, Hugh Hefner, circa 1961?  That\u2019s not right though \u2013 like some kind of dated figure from the 1950s who owns a huge mansion and a well-stocked bunker AND he has multiple girlfriends.  Like\u2026 a Bond villain\u2026?  I feel like he\u2019s in costume.  Which is fine.  He\u2019s still a lovely man, and I would still hit it.\nAnd here\u2019s Jeremy Irons, also looking scarfy and grizzled.  That\u2019s his wife, Sinead Cusack, by his side.  Poor Sinead.  I haven\u2019t been able to look at Jeremy the same way ever since this story about his \u201copen\u201d marriage and his handsy, groping, sexual-harassing ways.\nComments are Closed\nWe close comments on older posts to fight comment spam.\nEve\nsays:\nYES!\n.\nhahaha! Love it! Yes, I do heart the Gos but get why you don\u2019t. He\u2019s such the poser.\nI think you tend to like the less pretty but very talented kinda dirty weird boys (well, those are the ones I like).\nnormades\nsays:\n(But not since he has a wife.)\nDon\u2019t even mind the glasses and hair. Wish the pants matched the vest, and fit better.\nBad Gal Addiction\nHere\u2019s a cute pic: http://www.listal.com/viewimage/486854h\nHow tall is Mr.Bettany ?\nOriginal Tiffany\nHe didn\u2019t look that tall in person to me. My husband was on a Late night talk show the same night as he was and Jennifer was with him. But again, I am tall and had on heels, so I was well over six feet that day.\nI didn\u2019t find him very attractive in person, but I think he looks better with short hair. His nose freaks me out.\nUnder one condition: the blue-tinted glasses would have to go.\nThat said, I\u2019m keeping my fingers crossed for PB and JC, they seem solid.\nAnswer to the question is no.\nI think Irons would probably fare better in the female stakes than Bettany, who looks like the ideal candidate (esp in the first picture) to play Futurama\u2019s Farnsworth.\nReally funny how the judgment changes.\nand sexy!

If you are 18 and the size of your forehead is increasing, the great unwashed will put you down as 32. The age of your big sister/half sister.\nThe second biggest ager is, arguably, the degree of greyness of the hair you have left, whatever your age.\nUnfairly, this is quadruply so if you are a woman. Particularly the baldness.\nSilver foxes or grey nomads\nIf you are a man \u2014 again unfairly \u2014 the greyness can work in your favour, however. Think George Clooney, soccer coach Jose Mourinho, or even Barack Obama.\nGrey can be hot and a bad dye job that's way past it's sell-by date \u2014 think Paul McCartney, Sylvester Stallone, Charlie Sheen \u2014 looks bad and screams \"I really am quite old, you know\".\nAdvertisement\nSome other famous names \u2014 Tom Jones, Clive Palmer, Rupert Murdoch \u2014 have seen the light (and shade) of late and have dumped the dye for a more age-appropriate, natural look. And they look all the better for it. \u00a0\u00a0\nHairdresser Jack Morton is Australia's Creative Colourist of the Year 2014 but even he counsels not disguising the grey too much, whatever your age. And whatever age you are trying to pull off.\n\"It depends what type of look you want but men can look distinguished with grey hair,\" says Morton.\nA colourful opinion\nNevertheless Morton\u00a0has a very large male clientele, a good percentage of them executives wanting to dye their grey hair. Some come in every fortnight for touch-ups.\nIt is not as drastic as it sounds. Morton says that \u2014 in the right hands \u2014 men's colour is subtle. The trick is to get in relatively early. If more than 20 to 30 per cent of your hair is grey, it look obvious if you start dyeing it.\n\"When you start going grey you can get good results blending the grey hair. It's still salt and peppery,\" Morton says.\n\"The products used on men cover 70 per cent, whereas women want total coverage (of grey hair).\"\nThere are professional products specifically designed for men's hair.\n\"Or it's down to the application,\" says Morton. \"A high percentage of grey is around the hairline so there is some craftmanship involved.\"\nSo, do not try this at home.\nMaintenance men\nIt's not as high-maintenance as it sounds. You can be in and out in 40 minutes, and the dye's designed to slowly fade out. (Or of course it's cut out if you like to keep yourself looking sharp with cuts every three or four weeks).\nSome salons have payment plans for men because, with their more regular hair cuts, they have a higher frequency of colour jobs to women.\n\"Men come in more often,\" says Morton.\nAre you one of the many men who have joined the \"dark side\"? When did you start covering your greys? And has anyone ever commented?\nContains:\nCulture\nGrooming\nThis article contains a photo gallery\nSpit & Polish\nAdvertisement\n",

There are few things more powerful than an excellent educator, and we are thrilled to celebrate those who continue to devote their talent and time to opening doors of opportunity for students.\nThe mission of Teach For America is to ensure all children have the opportunity to attain an excellent education. With over 10,000 Teach For America alumni working toward this mission everyday as classroom teachers, we are honored to recognize 8 as this year\u2019s Excellence in Teaching awardees.\nThe awardees come from different backgrounds, take different approaches to their classroom, and model our core values of Transformational Change, Leadership, Team, Diversity, and Respect and Humility. They teach across a wide range of grades, content areas, ability levels, and schools \u2013 since the award\u2019s inception, we\u2019ve also seen a balance of recipients across charter schools and traditional district schools serving low-income children and families. While each has made a profound impact on students in their own classrooms and beyond, no two are the same and they are all reflective of the diversity of thought among our alumni teachers.\nThese teachers are just a small sample of educators proving what is possible when we provide students with the opportunities, supports, and guidance to succeed. NAATE provides top teachers with an intense program that balances instructional mastery and leadership. We are proud to welcome this year\u2019s awardees into the upcoming cohort.\nYou\u2019ll be hearing a lot more from these educators as they embark upon a year-long ambassadorship, representing their students, schools, and communities in professional learning opportunities provided as NAATE program Teacher Fellows. They\u2019ll also be sharing these experiences right here on Pass the Chalk during the 2014-15 school year.\nWithout further ado, let\u2019s get to know them.\nHilah Barbot (Greater New Orleans\u2013Louisiana Delta Corps \u201909): 6th Grade Science, KIPP Central City Academy, New Orleans, LA\nHilah Barbot\u2019s carefully crafted classroom focuses on joy \u2013 putting students in a position to love science and invest in their own futures. Hilah is the highest performing 6th grade science teacher in the city of New Orleans, with her students demonstrating 99 percent proficiency and gaining over two years of growth in a single academic year. She also orchestrates a yearly science fair where students create and conduct their own experiments in front a panel of judges, and is a blended learning director, content leader, and science benchmark writer for the KIPP\u2019s New Orleans region.\nCraig Brandenburg (Houston Corps \u201901): 9th Algebra I and Video Production, YES Prep North Central, Houston, TX\nOver the course of his career Craig Brandenburg has lead his students to remarkable academic success and he is in the 1 percent of teachers within the YES network who are classified as Master Teachers, and has maintained this level of excellence for over 10 years. On top of his classroom duties, Craig founded a student video production company, yBlazers, which eventually transformed into a student-run business generating nearly $60,000 in profit since its launch. Through the production company, students have gained internships, paying job opportunities, and important connections with people around the country.\nStephanie Hinton (South Louisiana Corps \u201907): 8th Grade English, KIPP Central City Academy, New Orleans, LA\nStephanie Hinton believes that the internalization of goals has not only led her students to academic success, but also to truly understanding themselves and adopting behaviors that are essential to altering their life outcomes. 94 percent of Stephanie\u2019s students passed the Louisiana Educational Assessment Program \u2013 the state\u2019s key academic benchmarks. As a regional ELA content lead and reading facilitator, Stephanie is implementing new programs to create text-rich schools. She also works at KIPP Deerfield\u2019s summer program to provide a high quality education to her students year-round.\nKathy Hollowell-Makle (D.C. Region Corps \u201998): Kindergarten, Abram Simon Elementary School, Washington, D.C.\nIn her 15 years as a classroom teacher, Kathy Hollowell-Makle has embodied the mission, vision, and values of Teach For America.\u00a0 She has been rated a highly effective teacher by DC Public Schools for the last 3 years, and in 2013 was named the district\u2019s teacher of the year. At the core of her teaching, she desires for every student to know that she believes in them, their parents believe in them, and their school believes in them \u2013 and leverages this belief toward the growth of her students.\u00a0 She was honored at President Obama\u2019s 2014 State of the Union Address.\nCrischelle Navalta (Rio Grande Valley Corps \u201905): 11th & 12th Grade Theory of Knowledge, IDEA College Preparatory Donna an IB World School, Donna, TX\nChrischelle Navalta\u2019s strength lies in her relationships with students and their families both inside and outside the classroom \u2013 and even outside their years in high school. She practices culturally responsive teaching and works with students quietly and persistently to help them succeed. Her 12th grade students received the highest passing rate in her school\u2019s history on the International Baccalaureate (IB) Theory of Knowledge content test, a major contributing factor to the fact that 95 percent of her students are eligible, upon graduation, for at least 1 college course based on their scores on their scores on the IB assessments.\nSara Needham Butler (Chicago Corps \u201907): 6th Grade Special Education, STRIVE Prep\u2013Montbello, Denver, CO\nAs described by a colleague, \u201cMs. Needham epitomizes what it means to uphold the Strive Prep promise that we make to all students and their families that they will get to and through a four year college.\u201d\u00a0 Sara involves her students in the creation of their academic growth goals, and provides them with the opportunity to make learning choices that best suite them. Thanks to the incredible investment she\u2019s garnered through these inclusive and differentiated practices, Sara\u2019s students have made the highest overall growth on TCAP (Colorado\u2019s state assessment) of all 6th grade students in Denver.\u00a0\nSara\u2019s support for students goes beyond effective instruction \u2013 she also seeks grants for additional classroom resources and was named a STRIVE Master Teacher, the highest level of recognition given to teachers in the Strive Prep network.\nThomas Rochowicz (Bay Area Corps \u201904): 12th Grade Civics and Economics, Washington Heights Expeditionary Learning School, New York, NY\nThomas Rochowicz is a Nationally Board Certified teacher and a Teach Plus Policy Fellow. A colleague describes him as, \u201cThe most thoughtful and reflective teacher I know....What makes him exceptional is how deeply he reflects on his practice.\u201d Thomas helps his students apply their knowledge of fundamental philosophies on government to present-day issues \u2013 as a result Thomas\u2019s students demonstrate greater confidence and independence.

            "75": "Switched On: A Frank Conversation With Author John Elder Robison\n[image: Book cover, with the title,\n\"Switched On: A Memoir of Brain\nChange and Emotional Awakening\"]\nThe new book Switched On is author John Elder Robison's deeply personal account of seismic shifts in his emotional, social, and perceptual responses to other people, the world, and his own memories -- due to participating in brain research on Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and autism. I spoke with Mr. Robison about his hopes in choosing this journey, its costs in terms of his own health and happiness, his autism advocacy, and the risk of frantic parents assuming his story means they need to use TMS on their autistic kids.\nThinking Person's Guide to Autism: Are you concerned that people might see Switched On as an  argument for \u201cnormalization\u201d treatments for autistic people? Even though  you are careful to emphasize that \u201cwe cannot know the future, or the  potential, of anyone,\u201d even though you rail against those who see  anything atypical as being \u201cbroken,\u201d and even though you describe your  autism diagnosis as \u201cempowerment\u201d?\nJohn Elder Robison: I am  already seeing people raising these questions online.\u00a0 The first thing I  want to say is, let\u2019s cut through the bullshit.\u00a0 There are no amorphous \u201cpeople\u201d looking to \u201cnormalize autistics.\u201d We have moved a long way  toward the world of Fahrenheit 451, but not that far.\nWhat  we do have are parents who may want to subject their children to  powerful therapies like TMS in hopes of \u201ccuring their autism.\u201d They may  do that after hearing scientists talk of the power of early  intervention. I think that is a huge risk, not just with TMS, but with  powerful interventions in general. I have raised that question and  continue to do so in my government committee service.\nSo  let\u2019s ask that another way: Should we be concerned that some parents  will subject children to TMS just as they subject kids to powerful  chelation, bleach enemas, and other ugly \u201ctreatments\u201d in a quest to \u201ccure their autism.\u201d And to that I say, yes, we have good reason to  worry. It\u2019s already happening with things like chelation.\nBut TMS and my book are not the problem. The problem is one of  societal shame around autism and parental inability to accept what is. There is no ethical problem with an adult like me going into TMS therapy  eyes wide open. Using TMS to reshape a five-year-old is a lot  chancier.\nThe problem is that we have a good ability to diagnose autism  in very young children, but we do not have a good way to predict  degrees of future disability or exceptionality. To apply TMS to those  kids might head off any prospect of exceptionality and it might be the  normalization some advocates fear.\u00a0 So what can we do about that? Since  we can\u2019t stop the forward progress of science that leaves education --  the same tool we have to address ethical risks of autism and genetic  tests. My advice is to start the conversation now, because therapies  like this are coming, and I think my book opens the dialogue.\nThe  other problem we must address is ignorance, or pseudo-knowledge. Somehow, in the last few decades, science in America has lost ground to  faith and superstition. When I was growing up, we were taught evolution  in science class. Period. Now, schools \u201cteach the evolution-creation  controversy,\u201d or they \u201cteach both sides.\u201d There is no controversy,  among credible scientists. Yet a large portion of the American public  now doubts the evidence of evolution; one of the foundation theories of  modern biology.\nTPGA: Where does that leave a complex science-based therapy like TMS?\nJER: That  sets the scene for parents -- most of whom have no formal education in  science or medicine -- to question everything they hear when it comes to  autism and what should be done to accommodate, treat, or cure it. What  some see as fringe science or even child abuse is perceived by others as  smart parenting and standing up for our kids. We have a world where  people equate TMS protocols developed at Harvard Medical School with  bleach enemas they saw at an autism conference. When those people have  guardianship of autistic children we have good cause to worry.\n[I think] TMS  is one of the most powerful tools available to the neurologists of  tomorrow. Our goal should be to make sure TMS therapies are developed  and used in a responsible manner. That means supporting research into  the many possible applications, and examining the ethical questions  presented by such a powerful tool.\nTPGA: Your (now ex-)wife Martha and your son Cubby both thought you were fine before TMS, and Martha\u2019s fears about you not needing her to be your emotion detector came to fruition -- you ended up divorcing. You were devastated that TMS caused you to lose your \u201cemotional shield,\u201d in terms of suppressing difficult childhood memories, and suddenly being able to perceive negative emotions in general \u2014 and patronizing or unkind behavior from people you\u2019d previously considered friends specifically. You even had suicidal thoughts. Yet you were able to connect with and understand the emotional motivations of customers better, had remarkable and unprecedented emotional responses to music, and made a pact with yourself not to be mean. Was your TMS experience worth the journey and personal costs?\nJohn Elder Robison\nwearing glasses and a striped polo shirt.]\nJER: Looking back at the experience I\u2019d say the benefits were great, but the cost was very high. Contrary to what I had thought, \u201cgetting smarter\u201d is not a free ride.\nFor me, the TMS journey is intertwined with writing and autism advocacy. There\u2019s no doubt I am more successful relating to casual acquaintances and business clients than I was a decade ago. And I don\u2019t doubt that TMS facilitated a lot of that change. Yet I sometimes wonder where I\u2019d be, had none of that ever happened. My business was considerably more successful before I took up writing and autism advocacy, and it\u2019s quite possible I would be much more secure today if I\u2019d simply stayed the course with cars and never picked up the \u201cautism pen.\u201d\nThat said, I have no doubt that my greatest gift to the world has been the sharing of my ideas about autism and growing up with the world. My car repair business never served a social purpose as my advocacy does. I do have critics and detractors but the overall commentary toward my work is strongly positive (hopefully that continues with this Switched On!!) But that\u2019s a benefit to the broad public. What about the benefit to me? That is less obvious.\nI certainly appreciate that my advocacy work has made me friends everywhere I go, and that is a remarkable thing.\u00a0 And I appreciate that my advocacy work has taken me all over the world, something few people get to experience. The question is, am I happier having done that, versus remaining in my small city and running the car company? I don\u2019t know. I doubt it.\nAs I travel and meet autistic people around the world I see a mix of hope for a better future and sadness for the oppression and discrimination past and present. I feel compelled to speak out, but that does not give me happiness. It\u2019s more like a duty that I am driven to try and fulfill. I do my best with it, and maybe that has to be enough. As much as I enjoy meeting people and feeling like I am doing some good, the travel is exhausting and the stress wears me out.\nFor me, one central problem is that I am never able to relax and get free of anxiety for extended periods of time. I read that autistics are at greater risk of mortality and I suspect that is one reason -- many autistic adults share my anxiety issues. It would be great if there was a therapy to relieve that.\u00a0 My anxiety is worse now then before I wrote my first book.\nI volunteered for the TMS study because I hoped to relieve what I saw as a continuing disability in me -- my limited ability to meet and engage people. I also hoped I might take part in developing a therapy that could help younger autistics. I wanted to do that because I remember how difficult my own earlier years were. I believe I got what I hoped for and more, but there was a high price to pay for the insight and ability.\nTPGA: What are your thoughts about TMS not building new brain pathways, but \u201cturning on\u201d what\u2019s already there? Especially considering that autistic development is atypical, and many autistic adults report punctuated but increasing skill development and emotional maturity as they age. Also a lot of autistic people report being incredibly emotionally perceptive, often to the point of being overwhelmed, like you bursting into tears after your first TMS session, or your resonating with Martha and her debilitating depression. Is it possible that TMS jump-started your next phase of autistic growth?\nBefore TMS: Robison's photo\nof Journey's Neal Schon\nbrown hair, mid-shred.]\nJER: Yes, I think TMS supercharged the process of plastic change for me, with respect to people skills. The dramatic rate with which I acquired those skills after TMS was unmatched before or since in my life. The change in how I process photos was sudden, striking, and seemingly permanent. Those are both examples of plastic change.\nToward the end of Switched On I talk about visiting the labs of Marcel Just and Nancy Minshew in Pittsburgh.\u00a0 They are studying the way autistic brains continue to develop throughout life, and indeed they measure changes in autistics 50, 60, and older. The Switched On story is a vivid demonstration of that, in my case.\nI don\u2019t have any way to know if TMS started a phase of growth or if it just supercharged particular areas of development. The thing is, the brain is so heavily interconnected that stimulation in one brain region could in principle have an affect almost anywhere else.\nAfter TMS: Robison's photo\nof Kansas's Dave Ragsdale\ncolors are highly saturated.]\nTPGA: You were careful to highlight that being \u201cemotionally blind\u201d is not the same as not caring, and you cite a study in which autistic participants had identical physical (sweating, etc.) reactions to witnessing others in pain to non-autistic participants, even if their behavioral reactions differ and might be imperceptible to non-autistic observers. How do you think other people can be more considerate of autistic people\u2019s emotional capacities?\nJER: That is a hard thing to answer. What the study you cite showed was that autistic people have strong reactions to scenes they witness even as their faces and bodies gave little or nothing away. When it comes to dealing with other people and their reactions to us, that non-response is a problem. If we give no sign of reaction, we will be treated as if we do not care about the event just witnessed. That may have a negative impact on the autistic person but I don\u2019t see how we are going to change that with the public, only ourselves.\nAfter TMS: Robison's photo of an abandoned\nrailroad bridge in Dover, Vermont\n[image: Inside of old metal railroad bridge,\nagainst a blue sky.\nPhoto colors are highly saturated.]\nWe can certainly learn when a response is expected, but I don\u2019t think we need TMS for that. It\u2019s a skill we can acquire right now, by paying close attention to the dynamics around us. If my experience is a guide TMS could help but it\u2019s an issue we can address either way. In my opinion this is the kind of skill we are wise to learn.\nBut that\u2019s not what you asked. You asked how other people can be more considerate. I don\u2019t see how we individuals can make other people more considerate, or change them at all in the short term. Education may have that long term effect. Legislation may help. But changing the public\u2019s view of autistics is going to be just as long a road as changing the public\u2019s view of (for example) African-Americans or Hispanics. I think members of those groups would say the American public has a long way to go in that area, even after fifty years of effort.\u00a0\nTPGA You mentioned several times that autistic brains are wired differently than non-autistic brains, with both more and fewer internal connections, depending on the brain region. You also mentioned that autistic brain plasticity is unique. What is the current state of research in these areas of autistic neurology?\nJER: Marcel Just is publishing studies on that now. I described his collection of brain imagery from autistics of all ages in Switched On. It\u2019s a slow process, building his database. In the next decade I think researchers like Marcel will learn a great deal more about the connective paths in autistic brains versus non-autistic brains.\nA few years ago Marcel published a paper in which he answered an age old philosopher\u2019s question via brain imagery: \"When you and I see a red ball, do we see the same thing in our minds? If I were to step into your mind at that moment, would the ball be red, or would it be green?\"\nBy looking at the areas of the brain that light up when seeing balls of different colors, and by measuring our emotional responses to what we see, Marcel was able to establish that you and I do indeed see the same red ball. That level of brain imaging can tell us a great deal about how autistics and non-autistics process the world we experience.\nTPGA: I didn\u2019t realize until reading Switched On that you\u2019d been diagnosed with prosopagnosia (face blindness) as an adult. That's not surprising in general as it's a common trait in autistic people, but it was surprising to me as you've always seemed to recognize me before I greet you. Can you share some of your strategies for recognizing people without relying on facial features?\nJER: I do not know how I recognize people, given my abysmal results on the standard face recognition tests. All I can say is that it\u2019s in context. I recognize cars when they drive into our service department and match them to their owners. I recognize people in situations. For example I recognize you reliably in the autism conference settings where we meet. But if I ran into you at the county fair, I might not recognize you at first.\nI suspect recognition is a combination of situation, overall look (rather than just facial appearance) sound, smell, dress, patterns of behavior. However we do it, many autistics with face blindness get by well enough that the disability is never detected. So you might say it\u2019s not a functional disability even as it shows up as one on lab tests.\nHere is an interesting twist: When I queried the scientists (who were not autistic) they could not tell one black Mercedes from another. \u201cThey all look the same.\u201d But to me, each Mercedes was an individual to be recognized. Does that mean I use the \u201cface recognizing areas\u201d to recognize machines? It\u2019s a question for future study, one that may suggest some of us are adapted that way for a reason.\nThere\u2019s no doubt most people benefit from recognizing other humans. But it\u2019s just as certain that there are circumstances were recognizing a specific car, or animal, or something else is of equally vital importance. And maybe that was one of our places in society long ago. That\u2019s an example of something that is almost universally called a disability today yet it may have evolved to facilitate our species\u2019 survival.\nTPGA: You write that \u201cautism has given me a mix of disabilities and gifts,\u201d including abilities you didn\u2019t always realize other people lacked, like being able to perceive and count fluorescent light bulb pulses, and connect with and understand machines. I\u2019m wondering how much you think your disability has to do with our society\u2019s lack of understanding and accommodation for people who think differently?\nJER: Well, my disability meeting and engaging people is not a societal thing. It\u2019s an autistic thing.\u00a0 If I have a problem reading expressions, eyes, body language and I respond in such a way that people are put off or reject me ... that is not really a society problem. And that was what I hoped to address with my own TMS.\nI was disabled in that regard at age five, and age forty-five. And I would have been disabled in the same way, had I lived in 1916 or 1716. The only difference would be that the farther I went back in time the smaller the group of people around me would be and the fewer strangers I would meet (as a general rule). That might have reduced the impact of that particular disability but it would still have been there.\nTMS did help with that, and my ability to engage new people is markedly improved today.\nI have other traits of disability (GI trouble, minor Tourette's-like shaking, perseveration, and anxiety) that are also autistic and not societal. As it happens, the TMS study I took part in did not target those issues, and they would have been the same in any place or time. That said, there are TMS studies looking into anxiety and perseveration by stimulating different regions.\nSome of the societal exclusion issues I talk about in my earlier books (such as failing me in school when I gave a right answer but could not show my work) were not really addressed by the TMS study I took part in.\nTPGA: How worried are you about unscrupulous cure-mongers, and others, using your book to push TMS as an autism treatment (some agencies are are already offering TMS for autism ) despite all your caveats -- including that your personal experience was research, not therapy?\nJER: Switched On describes TMS as a promising therapy for certain aspects of autistic disability, subject to further scientific study and validation. Every scientist you meet in my book is associated with a major university medical school. I specifically raise the concern that TMS by its nature could be administered by anyone, anywhere. So, yes, there is a concern about that but it\u2019s not because of my book. It\u2019s the nature of the technology.\nWhen you raised this question you cited as an example a paper on the Brainsway website .\u00a0 As it happens Brainsway is one of the makers of TMS equipment approved by the FDA to treat depression. It should not surprise us that Brainsway is supporting research into using their devices to treat other issues -- like autism. My concern is not with them. My concern is that TMS devices are easy for electronic technicians to make, and in principle home built machines could pop up anywhere.\nRight now, you can go online and order a do-it-yourself direct current brain stimulation device that is marketed as a tool to sharpen video gaming skills. That kind of thing concerns me but as that example shows, my book is not the driving force. Rather, it\u2019s the opposite -- it opens the ethical discussion.\nAt this moment the TMS equipment makers will only sell systems to doctors trained in their use. Can those doctors use the machines \u201coff-label?\u201d Sure. But I don\u2019t know if the ethical issues there are any different from those of the medical doctor using traditional psychiatric meds off label. In both cases we have to assume they are trained licensed professionals with the best interests of patients at heart.\u00a0\nSure, you will say, not all doctors meet that high standard. But again that is not a TMS issue. It is a \u201crogue doctor\u201d issue.\nTPGA: What would you say to those who ask how you could evangelize an unproven autism treatment even though you have said you are OK as you are?\nJER: Social isolation is one of the biggest components of disability for autistic people.\u00a0 The inability to \u201cread other people\u201d is at the heart of that, and my TMS experience shows that we have the ability to do that locked inside us. In this case \u201clocked inside\u201d is a very apt term, as TMS activated the ability in me for a time, but even with knowledge and experience I cannot access it on my own.\nThe fact that TMS \u201cswitched on\u201d the ability strongly suggests that the wiring is in place, as there was no time for my brain to build paths, and I did not need any practice to use the skill.\nIf you had experienced that -- as I have -- you would push for more research into it, too. Accepting how I am does not preclude my embrace of therapies or tools to make myself the best I can be.\nAs for it being an unproven treatment -- of course it\u2019s unproven. The book is a story of participation in scientific research. That is clear. The only way we get proven treatments for anything is to do the studies. Switched On makes a strong statement regarding the potential for TMS, and I hope it drives further attention and study.\nThat brings me to a larger philosophical question. Do autistics need treatment at all? If you say \u201cI am an autistic person\u201d you are describing a way of being, and you may well feel you are fine with your place in the world just as you are. Or you may wish for help with certain autism-related problems.\u00a0 When it comes to autism problems, social disconnect is a big one and it surprises me that people are so quick to challenge a possible helpful therapy.\nRight now, for social isolation, we have next to nothing. With TMS there is a possibility of real help for those who want it.\nTPGA: What\u2019s next for TMS?\nJER: The Switched On narrative shows the power of the TMS technology. Right now, TMS is available to treat depression at 1,000 clinics nationwide. Given that a large percentage of autistic people suffer from depression, this should be welcome news.\nThe studies described in Switched On continue, and they could be accelerated if there was public pressure on the funding sources. Going forward, TMS is under study for anxiety in autistic people. It\u2019s being tested to improve executive function, and to suppress the cravings of addiction.\nTMS is also being studied as a tool to suppress epileptic seizures. That could be a lifesaver for people who are more severely impacted.\nSwitched On is the first account of transformative change with an emergent medical technology.\u00a0 It\u2019s my hope that it will start a conversation that leads to greater progress in research and greater understanding of the profound ethical questions we will face as we learn to help the mind rewire itself.\nPosted by\n2016-03-23T14:58:00-07:00\nNeuroTribes: Now in Paperback\nNeuroTribes will change the way you think about autism.

It's a scissors-only cut with some layered length on top and about an inch to an inch and a half on the sides. Style with a light pomade or fiber cream.\u00a0\nGetty\nThe Wavy Business Casual\nIf you've got a bit of wave to your hair, embrace it\u00a0with a little more length on the sides. Then apply some pomade or light styling cream and brush it all back, running your fingers through it to add\u00a0separation.\nGetty\nThe '90s Party On Top, Business Down Below\nThis style requires a barber who can do a bit of sculpture, but done right it's a solid retro look. Obviously you want a tight fade on the sides and back, but without the slow taper of the high-and-tight. And for the top, volume is good, but you want to keep it sculpted. Too many strays will ruin the look.\u00a0\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\nThe James Dean\nYou know you've left a cultural mark when you basically have a hairstyle named after you. This look is great for guys with really thick hair. The only problem is, while it has a devil-may-care insouciance to it, it actually takes some work to get it right. Ask your barber for a layered cut on top\u00a0with some length in the front, and then taper it\u00a0down the sides. When it's wet, blow dry it straight back.\u00a0Then apply a clay or a heavier pomade, and\u00a0run your fingers through the top\u00a0to pull it up to give it some height. Then hope that it's not a windy, humid, or rainy day.\u00a0\nGetty\nHarry Styles\nThe Bohemian\nIf you're lucky enough to have hair this great, just grow it, man. Maybe stop in to the barber for an occasional trim to keep things from getting too out of control, but a little wild is what you're looking for here.\u00a0\nGetty\nThe Classic Close-Crop Fade\nAlthough you'll have to make regular visits to the barber, this is an easy-to-maintain classic look. With\u00a0clippers, have it cut to a 2-to-4 setting on top, with a fade down to a 1 (or even to the skin) on the sides and back. Just make sure you have a good head shape before diving into this cut.\nGetty\nThe Rebel (a.k.a. The Cool Musician)\nSort of like the James Dean but without all the work. The trick to this cut is just to keep it relatively short on the sides\u00a0and then to let things go wild on top. This is actually a pretty solid choice too for those with ultra straight hair\u2014the kind that grows out rather than down on the sides. It'll keep you from looking like a walking dandelion.\nGetty\nThe Cool Art Student\nIf you're the guy who always knows the coolest new music, has the coolest creative job that everyone wishes they had, and always wears the coolest, most stylish clothes, this is your 'do. Much like The Bohemian, you just kind of grow it out\u00a0and let things go a little wild, trimming when necessary.\nGetty\nJason Statham\nThe Badass\nThe brutal truth is, not all guys have full heads of hair to work with. But that doesn't have to be a bad thing. Trimming out down to a 1 cut can be\u00a0a pretty badass\u00a0look. You just need to wear it with confidence and\u00a0a hint of attitude.\u00a0\nGetty\nEsquire participates in various affiliate marketing programs, which means Esquire gets paid commissions on purchases made through our links to retailer sites.\n\u00a92017 Hearst Communications, Inc.

We understand those fears and concerns and want the experience of getting a professional headshot to be fun as well as a good value. Jeff Kennedy perfectly describes the experience we create at our headshot days.\nJeff came to our SRK Headshot Day in San Francisco because he didn\u2019t want to put off getting an updated headshot any longer: \u201cThe time had come to update the photo on my website, newsletter and social media pages, and I was dreading what I imagined would be an uncomfortable afternoon in a dark, stuffy room, where everyone including the photographer would be wishing they were somewhere else. Instead, after receiving days before the shoot (without even asking for it) plenty of helpful information regarding how to optimize the shoot, I was greeted warmly and on time by Scott\u2019s stylish team who asked if I\u2019d like a drink. From that point forward, it was clear that Scott and his team had developed a friendly and efficient process that operated like a well-oiled machine. While Patricia considered the best order for shooting with the clothes I brought, Monica got me some water. Then, while Monica applied some make-up, Patricia reviewed my website and LinkedIn profile to get a sense of who I am, what I do, and how the pictures will be used. I\u2019m not sure how many photos Scott took with three different outfits and two backdrops, but I was out of there in 30 minutes as scheduled and within a couple days I had 69 proofs to review with 5 marked as Scott\u2019s favorites. A week after choosing my favorites, I had two sets of high-resolution photos for printing and smaller photos for use on the web, all cropped with several uses in mind. I felt instantly at ease and respected by their timely, methodical and calm approach, and I couldn\u2019t be happier with the pictures and value I received!\nJeff Kennedy is the principal consultant and attorney with HR By Your Side.\u00a0 Jeff enables employers and individuals to maximize opportunities through expert, effective and affordable human resources consulting and legal advice, including confidential partnership, strategic guidance and tactical support.\u00a0 You can find out more about Jeff and HR By Your Side at www.hrbyyourside.com .\nClick here to see all the\u00a0 Headshots of the Week .

            "40": "The Top Beard Styles for Men\nBeards have been ever growing in popularity and it looks like they\u2019re here to stay for a while. We\u2019ve taken a look at the best and coolest beard styles for men to offer you some tips, tricks and inspiration should you wish to dabble in the facial hair trend.\u00a0\nThe Best Beard Styles for Men\nFor most men, the beard type they choose is usually dictated by how much facial hair they are capable of growing. That being said, it\u2019s always worth taking a look at the variety of chin beard\u00a0 styles out there should you wish to challenge yourself into growing something fuller or longer.\nBeard Styles for My Face Shape\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re looking to determine which beard is best for you, working out what face shape you are is a good place to start. By focusing on the three points along your face \u2013 the temple, the cheek and the jawline \u2013 you can work out your face shape relatively easily .\nOnce you have a clear idea of what face shape you are, you are then able to tailor the shape of your beard in order to create a look that is proportional.\nHeart Face Shape:\u00a0If you want to define your jawline try going for a square beard, which will work against your soft face shape and give you a more defined look.\nSquare Face Shape: Your choice of beard is dependent on how you want it to work alongside your strong jawline. If you want to enhance it \u2013 a goatee or defined beard will help to emphasise the structure within the lower half of your face. Otherwise, if you want to create some softness in your face then harsh lines in the beard and moustache should be avoided, instead, going for a light stubble.\nRound Face Shape:\u00a0We\u2019d recommend going for a defined beard in order to create angles, also, opting for longer, thinner sideburns will prevent your cheeks from looking fuller.\nRectangle Face Shape: These work well with a fuller/longer beard with shorter and wider sideburns to slightly widen the jawline.\nRound Face Shape:\u00a0To help give your face definition, elongate the face with a thinner, shaped beard, avoiding anything too bushy that will just morph your face.\nOval Face Shape:\u00a0You guys are the lucky ones. Due to the natural symmetry of your face, any beard will work.\nDiamond Face Shape:\u00a0Go for a beard shape that\u2019s relatively narrow to avoid adding extra weight to the face.\nOblong Face Shape:\u00a0A beard that ends a little wider, almost like a square, to ensure that there is symmetry with the rest of the hair.\nPHOTO CREDIT: HairStyleGalleries\nTypes of Beards\nEven just a quick Google search will tell you that the number of different styles of beards today is almost endless. With combinations of beard and moustache, full beards and shorter beards, there\u2019s a lot to offer. While\u00a0mutton chops beards might not everyone\u2019s favourite, there is genuinely a beard out there that will suit you, even if it\u2019s not the most conventional style.\u00a0\nPHOTO CREDIT: Tumblr\nThe Best Beard Styles for Men\nCheck out some of the best trendy beard styles for men out there at the moment.\u00a0Guys with beards have been around for centuries, but here are some examples of modern gents getting it right. The right\u00a0beard shape can do a lot to accentuate your features, so choose wisely and make sure you\u2019re choosing one that works well with your face shape.\u00a0\nBest Goatee Styles\nGiven its namesake from the animal, the \u201cgoatee\u201d is one of the most of the most well-known types of beards. If when you start to grow a beard , you notice that the growth is sparse and patchy around your cheeks, then this style is suited to you.\nThe traditional small beard on the end your chin is the perfect choice for those of you with a small and round face. In terms of length, keep it slightly longer to help to your face look slimmer. But with so many variations of the goatee to suit different face shapes, it is good to know that keeping it traditional isn\u2019t always best.\nFull Beard Styles\nFor maximum facial coverage, a full beard, or what some people call a\u00a0garibaldi beard,\u00a0is the way forward. With sideburns and or a moustache to contend with as well as the hair around the chin, this may be the option involving the greatest amount of effort but, arguably, it brings the greatest result.\nShort Beard Styles\nThe length of a beard isn\u2019t necessarily as important as some might think. Even during the early stages of growing a beard , you should be considering the shape of your stubble and the areas that naturally get covered quickest as this could help you to decided which of the longer beard styles you want to choose.\nLong Beard Styles\nAs with hair, deciding to have a longer beard is a greater commitment. With this comes a period of time where you lower face will probably become very itchy but, just wait it out. Using moisturiser will help you during this time but it is important to avoid products that contain alcohol in them as this can dry out your skin.\nWhatever style you choose for a longer length, the key is in the symmetry. Due to the sheer amount of extra hair you will be carrying on your face, if your beard isn\u2019t in proportion and styled to suit your face shape , it will stick out bigger than a sore thumb ever could.\nYour Quick Guide to\u00a0The Top Beard Styles for Men\nFind a beard that suits your face shape.\nDo be afraid to try out different combinations of beard and moustache.\nPlay around with different lengths and soft/defined cuts.\nUse celebrities as inspiration for what beards work.\nKnow how to take care of a beard, not just how to grow one.\nOn That Note\nNow you know about cool beards and different types of beards to suit your face. But, as well as knowing what type you want to grow, it is just as important to know how to style a beard. Although a beard haircut may be a little more effort, you\u2019ll soon see that, when done right, the results are worth it.\nWords By: Lauren Walton\n",

They are also normally included in your inclusive call minutes. Please note we may record some calls.\n03332 207 677 and say hello - Mon - Fri, 9am - 5pm\nCall 03332 207 677\n19th Nov 2012 Analytics , Usability 15 minutes to read\nLet me try again.\nSPOILER ALERT \u2013 This post contains humiliating photos of various \u2018haircuts\u2019 I\u2019ve had. You are allowed to laugh, to point, to mock, to tweet using vaguely amusing hashtags. But not too much though!\nOn to more serious issues then \u2013 let\u2019s talk websites (seems fair as this is, after all a digital marketing blog ). Let\u2019s say your company has a website. Let\u2019s say said website was designed a few years ago. You put your site into the hands of a designer, you signed it off and it went live. Great.\nFast forward (Delorean-styley, of course) a few years. Your rankings have tanked, traffic isn\u2019t great and it\u2019s just not converting. What do you do? Do you bravely soldier on and hope it will magically improve, or do you bite the bullet and invest in a redesign?\nIf you\u2019re on the ball, you\u2019ll have realised that I\u2019m going to be using an analogy of my haircuts (notice I don\u2019t use the word \u2018style\u2019) with your website. Yes, I know. But stick with me here. If nothing else you get to see silly photos of me. Oh, and one will be of a beard, not a haircut. It\u2019s my blog entry, I make the rules.\nSo let\u2019s get started as we take a rewind into the Grumpy SEO\u2019s back catalogue of follicle follies:\n\u2018The Basin\u2019\nQuite rightly the centre of much ridicule at school, the basin is a wonderfully simple, low maintenance haircut that just shouts \u201cmy Mum cuts my hair in the kitchen as she\u2019s too tight to take me to a hairdresser.\u201d I know this only too well, having been (somewhat justifiably, with hindsight) humiliated during my formative years for having such a hair \u2018style\u2019; here is me sporting the basin:\nThe \u2018basin\u2019 is harsh and demeaning \u2013 you have no choice about it and you walk around feeling like a fool (and cursing your parents). It\u2019s the lowest common denominator of hairstyles. It\u2019s about as inspiring as a losing lottery ticket.\nThe basin website, therefore, is one of two things \u2013\n1) where you work for a company with a shocking website that you know sucks but your boss refuses to change, or\n2) where you run a shocking website but you don\u2019t want to offend your designer/developer by pointing it out. Either way, you cringe any time you visit the site or when checking your traffic in Analytics. You feel trapped, you feel humiliated.\nA basin website is also basic, standard and cheap. It probably seemed like a bargain when you got it done; it may have impressed you when you were less digital-savvy. You might even have knocked it together yourself.\nThe basin is wrong, it\u2019s doing you no favours and people are laughing at you. It has to go and it has to go now. Sorry Mum, your scissors are no longer welcome.\n\u2018The Side Parting\u2019\nPost-basin days, I moved on to something only slightly less vile \u2013 the side parting (its latter life featuring excessive amounts of Insignia hair gel). For anyone under the age of 30 that\u2019s reading this, you may not have seen this abomination whilst at school. Let me tell you though, \u2018back in my day\u2019 it was omnipresent. This was another bright idea of my parents \u2013 whilst it was only somewhat less shameful than the awful \u2018basin\u2019 style, it did at least mean I got to enjoy the services of a hairdresser.\nHere is me looking like a complete chump:\nThe side parting has, like Rumbelows, Five Alive and Grange Hill, for the most part, died a death. This, ladies and gents, is for the best.\nThe side parting website, like its haircut namesake, is simply so old-school it\u2019s just wrong. It looks naff now, it probably felt naff even at the time and it needs a complete overhaul, pronto.\nSymptoms of a side-parting website include : tiled backgrounds, use of the Comic Sans font, frames, visible HTML tables, site structure built in HTML tables, \u2018under construction\u2019 images, typos and popups.\nThe side-parting site may well have been \u2018designed\u2019 by a friend (and that friend probably still thinks Meta keywords usage is awesome SEO).\nSide-parting sites are belittling your brand, making you look foolish, and the longer you have them, the harder it\u2019s going to be to grow that parting out. You can either (yes, another hair metaphor) shave it off, or go to a decent stylist to completely re-do it.\n\u2018The Indie Fringe\u2019\nI\u2019m showing my age here but aside from chart music (Tiffany et al), many of my earliest experiences in listening to new stuff came in the early 1990s with the indie and \u2018shoegaze\u2019 era. Hell, the first band I ever saw were the Cranberries at Oxford Jericho Tavern, supporting Moose. Back when they had long hair and were shy to the point of not being there (\u201cwe\u2019re the Cranberries from Limerick in Ireland\u201d whispered Dolores, as the entire band literally stared at their shoes/pedals before playing what can only be described as \u2013 at best \u2013 a mediocre set).\nLong hair and fringes were all the rage. No, really, they were. Look, I was there, OK? They instantly made you appear coy and shy with just a cheeky hint of mystery.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the analogy, Killworth?\u201d. Bear with me, readers.\nOK \u2013 the \u2018indie fringe website\u2019 basically lacks any calls to action. It isn\u2019t confident. It hides behind information and reads more like a Wiki page rather than someone keen to sell their product or service.\n\u201cOh I\u2019m so shy,\u201d it says. \u201cYou want MY product? Little old me? Well there is..like..a phone number in small font in the contact us page if you want it. But don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t need to click.\u201d\nIf you want to convert visitors into customers, you need to make it clear \u2013 very clear \u2013 what you want them do to and how they need to do it. This means taking a step back and thinking about how a visitor would behave if it was their first time on your site.\nYou need to be confident, bold, and have a clear way of getting that customer in contact with you/buying a product with you. Putting something like \u201cIf you have any questions about our services contact us here\u201d doesn\u2019t cut the mustard.\nHave a nice, bold, clear call to action button so if people are interested, they\u2019ll click it there and then. You have to dumb things down \u2013 not because your visitors ARE dumb, but because web users are impatient and it\u2019s oh-so easy to click away and go to another site. And if they do that they\u2019re probably not coming back. Ever.\nCall to action methods can and should be tweaked over time \u2013 split testing can give you some concrete figures about what works and what\u00a0doesn\u2019t\u00a0 Even minor things like shifting the position of the CTA button, or the colour of it, can impact this.\nMove away from just thinking about increasing traffic and think about improving conversion rate; this maximises the investment you\u2019ve made by putting money into SEO and/or PPC. Traffic is great but conversions pay.\nBe proud of your company, product and service; make it obvious you WANT people in contact with you and make it as clear as possible how to do so.\nBy the way, if you\u2019re wondering what happened to the indie fringe thing, it turned into longer \u2018curtains\u2019 which in turn had a \u2018trendy\u2019 and \u2018rebellious\u2019 shaved-undercut installed, before employing the then-popular \u2018uber-tight and slightly pushed up at the back\u2019 ponytail. I can\u2019t locate a photo \u2013 what a shame.\n\u2018The Dreadlocks\u2019\nPicture the scene, if you will. It\u2019s 1994. Summer. The Levellers and the \u2018crusty\u2019 scene is all the rage. Sort of. Castle Morton, Spiral Tribe and \u2018new age travellers\u2019 on the news. I\u2019m listening to Back To The Planet, New Model Army, and Radical Dance Faction. I am so rebellious. In a sort of middle-class way. I have long hair \u2013 awesome long hair. How could I possibly improve it?\nI know \u2013 I\u2019ll go to London (Kensington Market, since you\u2019re asking) and pay someone an exorbitant amount of money to backcomb and beeswax said hair into crudely fashioned \u2018dreads\u2019. And then spend the ensuing months desperately trying to keep them formed. And failing.\nLet\u2019s face it though, my dreads stank \u2013 both visually and literally. They had bits of beeswax in them, strands of hair sticking out as if they were trying desperately to escape the gluey mess.\nI\u2019m stretching a bit here and using a large chunk of poetic licence, but I\u2019m linking the \u2018anti-social\u2019 nature of my dreads, to the use (or non-use) of social media in today\u2019s business websites. (It\u2019s my blog post and I\u2019ll stretch if I want to).\nLook \u2013 if you\u2019re not using social, you\u2019re missing out on a trick. And most of the time it\u2019s a trick your competitors are all over. I don\u2019t think that social can be seen as an optional part of your online marketing campaign any more. It should be a natural extension of your website and one you should take seriously.\nWhich channels you utilise depends to an extent on your industry. The core three though should normally be Facebook, Twitter and Google Plus. If you have a product or service that\u2019s very \u2018visual\u2019 though, you should be all over Pinterest too (check out Lindt\u2019s chocloate Pinterest page for a great example).\nGot videos, or could you have videos? Get yourself on YouTube , stat. Again, this is about reaching out to engage with potential customers; getting your brand out there and generating those all-important links.\nWhat used to be niche is now mainstream; people now expect brands and companies they like to be on platforms like Facebook. Social should be a core part of your marketing campaign.\nAdditionally, you also need to move away from the \u2018woe is me\u2019 mentality of seeing social as a chore. Social gives you ways of engaging and communicating with your customers. Run well, a social campaign can create brand advocates who will share/like and rave about your products to your friends. Aside from time, social doesn\u2019t cost you anything, thus the long-term potential ROI is not to be sniffed at.\nWhat\u2019s also great about social is that you don\u2019t have to be overly formal or corporate. Have some fun and get away from thinking that posts/updates just have to be the same old ones about your products or services. You can (unless your industry means it\u2019s not appropriate) post things like funny stories, competitions, relevant news stories, have profiles/interviews of your staff members, \u2018top ten\u2019 lists.\nThese are just a few ideas \u2013 the bottom line is, get creative and be bold. Most of all, keep it regular; nothing is more depressing in Social than a Facebook page that hasn\u2019t been updated in years.\nIf you\u2019re stuck for inspiration, or think \u201csocial\u2019s a waste of time\u201d, take some time out to look what your competitors are doing. Check out how many followers/\u2019likes\u2019 they have, then tell me it\u2019s still a waste of time.\nBy the way, once the dreadlocks were clippered off, I went on to use them in an \u2018A\u2019 level sculpture of a half-organic, half-bionic man. As you do.\nThe \u2018Bright Hair Dye\u2019\nI was such a crazy, anarchic rebel in my late teens. Not only did I have dreads, ladies and gentlemen, but I took this craziness to new levels by (badly) spraying them red. This came out more of a pink but hey. I was crazy, dammit! To hell with social norms (I also had not one, not two, not three, but four nose piercings. Told you I was a rebel.)\nThe \u2018bright hair dye\u2019 website uses the \u2018distraction method\u2019 of including eye candy (think animations, overly bright colours, too much Flash, scrolling thingies) to try and cover up the fact the site has no real substance.\nIt\u2019s bells and whistles, but misses the point; it doesn\u2019t strive to deliver what the visitor wants, and panders more to the web developer\u2019s ego and perhaps that of the client, along with their naivety.\nIf your site employs on-site \u2018pretty things\u2019 that don\u2019t serve a purpose, or most likely, detract from the user experience, ditch them. There is nothing whatsoever wrong with a simple website with no animations, nothing at all. It\u2019s your business and your profits on the line \u2013 remember that the website needs to look and \u2018feel\u2019 good for your customers, not you.\nSo with your website, take a good, hard, long look at it. Ask someone who hasn\u2019t seen it before to look at it. Ask for honest feedback (and not from your Mum, as she\u2019ll undoubtedly say \u201cooh that\u2019s nice dear\u201d before making sure you\u2019ve wrapped up warm). Then be prepared to take action (not against your Mum). If your website has too much \u2018hair dye\u2019, wash it out!\nMy bright hair dye days were short-lived; some time afterwards I realised that not only were my dreads pathetic, but they stank, whilst the hair colour had deteriorated into a weak orange, like an anaemic satsuma, . After a fruitless attempt (which was frankly a triumph of ambition over common sense), I attempted to comb them out. Strangely, this proved futile and the poor things were goners.\n\u2018The Goatee\u2019\nMy extensive, arduous and prolonged research for this blog post reveals (according to Wikipedia) that \u2018\u2026since the 1990s goatees are popular to this day\u2019. Really? Where? Not on my watch, son. Not in the SEO world, oh no.\nIf you\u2019re reading this going \u201ca goatee isn\u2019t a haircut and thus you\u2019re spoiling the novelty/concept of an otherwise genuinely awesome blogpost\u201d you\u2019re absolutely right, but stick with me. Or you can write your own, as I hold no copyright on the concept.\nIn the late 1990s, however, goatees were all the rage. And yes, I had one, check out the non-awesomeness of mine:\nYes, mine was lame beyond all doubt; it looked like someone had stuck a bunch of spider\u2019s legs to my chin and upper lip, there was a weird bald bit in it, and there was even a hint of ginger in it. But I stubbornly stuck to this bad-boy during the heady days of 1999-2000 before realising that, well, it sucked.\nSo what is a \u2018goatee website\u2019? Well, this is a website which has picked up on a short-term trend and stuck with it, demonstrating entirely inappropriate stubbornness; think splash-screens, hit counters, pixelated fonts, and so on.\nA goatee website desperately wants to be trendy, edgy and to look like other sites. It puts a \u2018feature\u2019 on there that the owner has seen elsewhere. It wants to follow, not innovate. My grandmother once said that a beard \u2018is for men who want to cover a weak chin\u2019. The goatee website is covering a metaphorical weak chin; perhaps poor content or usability.\nThe goatee website, simply, needs to shave and accept that \u2018grunge\u2019 is no longer fashionable. Ditch the gimmicks go back to basics and put the visitor first.\n\u2018The Shaved Head\u2019\nNowadays\u00a0I\u2019ve\u00a0done away with hair entirely; \u201chair today, gone tomorrow\u201d. Ha. The truth is, once the dreads had gone, things were never the same for my head. Then, after several years of clippering it, I finally manned up and took a Mach 3 to it and\u00a0I\u2019ve\u00a0never looked back. The genius of this decision though, is that it will lessen the blow of actual baldness once I hit, say, 40.\nThe \u2018shaved head website\u2019 is simple, low maintenance, classic and feels nice to the touch.\nA good, modern website\u00a0isn\u2019t\u00a0about the ego of the designer or website owner; it\u2019s designed with the customer in mind. It\u2019s simple, it\u2019s intuitive and it\u2019s congruent with the brand. It\u2019s regularly updated (shaved) and tweaked (moisturised). It ties in with social. It isn\u2019t garish, it\u2019s usable and accessible.\nLike a shaved head, a well designed, well structured website is smooth, looks great and just needs occasional attention to keep it awesome. Like me (cough):\nThe shaved head site is what you want to aim for; your site\u00a0doesn\u2019t\u00a0need spray colours, it\u00a0doesn\u2019t\u00a0need messy dreads, and it certainly\u00a0doesn\u2019t\u00a0want a side parting. It has a cheeky shine to it in certain lights.\nHair aside, my point is this: reviewing and updating your website should be seen as an on-going job. Going for a re-design or site overhaul is a natural part of the e-marketing process. A website is never \u2018finished\u2019, in the same way an SEO campaign isn\u2019t.\nAnd in the same way that hair needs trimming or restyling, so does your website.

You meet a wonderful cross-section of people, and families and are generally rewarded by the results.\nWhy did you choose to go into this business?\nI was in the hotel restaurant management industry and they were talking about moving around corporately. I had decided a long time ago that I wanted to stay in Cranbrook. I've also always enjoyed dealing with people and doing customer service, so back in 1993, I decided to take my licensing course and get into real estate.\nWhat was the first job you ever had and what did you learn from it?\nMy first job was a dishwasher at Mr. Mike's in Victoria. I learned how to pad up a resum\u00e9 (Wheeldon laughs). The owner asked me what experience I had. I thought to myself, \"I'm 15 years old and I've never worked a job at all,\" but rather than not answering his question, I told him I was really good at washing dishes because my mom made me wash them all the time. With that answer, he hired me on the spot.\nWhat advice would you give to your younger self?\nLearn more from your surroundings. There is so much knowledge and so many learning opportunities from every interaction you have with a client or a colleague. Within your own professional network, there are a wealth of resources that are constantly around you, so try to absorb more.\nWhat is your number 1 passion outside work?\nI really enjoy community events and family activities. Our lives changed considerably 10 years ago when we had kids, and like all parents, our hobbies and passions went on the back burner. Now our kids' activities and passions come first.\nRelated articles\nJune 2017\nJune 2017\nJune 2017\nEast\u00a0Kootenay\nWest Kootenay\n",
            "50": "Generally, it is a norm for people to think that beard is only for those with a good looking hairstyle. But, like everything in this world, fashion trends too change with time. And Yes! Men with bald head too look good by sporting a beard or facial hairstyle that match their facial structure. Basically, there are two types of bald heads - permanent bald head and clean shaved head.\nIn the first type i.e., permanent bald head, there will be some hair on the sides of the head, whereas in the second type, it is completely hairless (those who choose to shave off a full head of hair).\nSo, it is very important to grow a beard style that balances your face shape and size so that you could attract the eyeballs towards your beard easily. You can give your personality an extra mile by sporting a cool beard style with the perfect dressing.\nDifferent Types of Beard Styles for Bald Heads\nYou can sport any of the below facial hairstyles for a trendy look. They are\nGoatee (Full or Classic)\n#1.Goatee\nHugh Jackman, who is popularly known for his role as a Wolverine in the X-Men series has got a completely new avatar (Blackbeard) for his role in the upcoming movie 'Pan'. He is sporting a beard style called 'Goatee' with twirled mustache and a shaved head. This facial hairstyle is also known as Van Dyke.\nThere are various styles of Goatee but everything falls under two categories - full goatee and classic goatee.\nThe full goatee is often seen in bikers, corporate people, construction men, evil twins from the outside world (just kidding) etc... It suits the class people as well as the mass.Whereas the classic goatee is often seen in rock stars (people related to music niche), IT guys and a lot of youngsters.\n#2.Stubble\nThis beard style is good particularly for men with bald head (some hair on the sides of the head). The aura of the stubble is sexy.\n#3.Full Beard\nThe full beard is actually a counter to the baldness . Instead of the hair on your head, you grow a beard on the face. The full beard is an excellent choice especially, for those who crossed their 40's. This style may look traditional, but you can customize it to look modern.\nBTW, who else would look great with full beard and bald head, other than our very own Bruce Willis?\n#4.Mustache\nIf you don't like to or not comfortable sporting a beard, then you can try to grow a mustache . The mustache is one of the best options to style with a bald head. Simply, leave your mustache unshaved for 3 or 4 days and it will blend with your face.\nHope these best beard styles for bald man are inspiring.

            "58": "Bartfrisuren Was ist ein Goatee?\nGef\u00fchlt sah man den so genannten Goatee vor allen Dingen in den 90ern an jedem zweiten Mann. Der Ziegenbart ist nicht ganz leicht in Form zu halten und bedarf eines speziellen Stylings und jeder Menge Pflege. Auch die Definitionen und Varianten des Goatees sind vielf\u00e4ltig. Ziegenbart ist nicht gleich Ziegenbart.\n\u00a9iStockphoto.com/Nikiteev_Konstantin\nGoatee: Spitzbart, Kreisbart oder Van Dyke?\nGrunds\u00e4tzlich kann der Goatee in unterschiedlicher L\u00e4nge und Auspr\u00e4gung getragen werden. Der Kinnbart wirkt m\u00e4nnlich und verpasst dem Gesicht markante Z\u00fcge. Doch nicht nur die L\u00e4nge des Barts variiert. Manch einer zwirbelt den Bart. Manch anderer flechtet seinen Goatee lieber. Kurzzeitig erlebte der Goatee ein Revival dank Hollywood. Brad Pitt, Jared Leto und Collin Farell zeigten, dass so ein Ziegenbart zwar wiederbelebt werden kann, aber auch, dass der Bart nicht automatisch sch\u00f6n ist, nur weil ihn ein Hollywood-Star tr\u00e4gt. In Kombination mit zerzausten Haaren wirkt der Goatee ab einer gewissen L\u00e4nge leider schnell ungepflegt und undefiniert. Damit Ihnen das nicht passiert, zeigen wir Ihnen, wie man den Goatee rasieren, pflegen und stylen muss, um nicht als Ziegenpeter durchzugehen.\nGoatee: Das richtige Styling in 5 Schritten\nLassen Sie Ihre Barthaare \u00fcber mehrere Tage hin wachsen. Nachdem einige Zeit vergangen ist, sollten Sie ein Gef\u00fchl daf\u00fcr bekommen, ob ein Goatee wirklich das richtige f\u00fcr Sie ist.\nWenn Sie zu der Entscheidung gekommen sind, dass es ein Goatee werden soll, sollten Sie sich Gedanken machen, wie dieser aussehen soll. Soll es ein \u00fcberschaubarer Goatee werden, der den Mund umschlie\u00dft, oder soll das Ganze schon eher in die Richtung Vollbart gehen?\nSind sie nun an dem Punkt angekommen, dass Sie Einfluss auf den Bartwuchs nehmen k\u00f6nnen, gilt es Folgendes zu beachten:\nGehen Sie bei der Rasur nicht \u00fcber die Lachfalten im Gesicht hinaus!\nFormen Sie scharfe Ecken am Kinn!\nWie immer bei der Rasur sollte man auch hier darauf achten, dass beide Seiten symmetrisch aussehen.\n\u00dcberdenken Sie die Wahl des Rasierers. Je nach Haarl\u00e4nge sollten Sie entscheiden, ob ein elektrischer Rasierer oder ein Langhaarrasierer Sinn macht.\nDer Goatee m\u00f6chte Aufmerksamkeit! Wer den Ziegenbart lange vernachl\u00e4ssigt, sieht schnell ungepflegt aus.\nDer Goatee kann super gut mit Kotletten kombiniert werden. Also trauen Sie sich! In diesem Fall darf \u201eMann\u201c Kotletten tragen.\nEin Ziegenbart sieht nur dann wirklich gut aus, wenn das Barthaar dicht und voll ist. Lichtes Haar ist hier fehl am Platze. Spezielle Haarstyling-Produkte k\u00f6nnen hier helfen.\nRasierprodukte Holen Sie das Maximum aus Ihrem Rasierschaum\nUnverzichtbar in jedem Bad, einer der wichtigsten Helfer f\u00fcr die Rasur und meistgenutztes Rasierprodukt f\u00fcr die Nassrasur: Der Rasierschaum. So finden Sie den perfekten Schaum f\u00fcr Ihr ultimatives Rasurerlebnis.\nRasierprodukte After Shave \u2013 der finale Touch f\u00fcr jede Rasur\nAuch wenn M\u00e4nnerhaut robuster als die von Frauen ist \u2013 t\u00e4gliches Rasieren geht nicht spurlos an Ihrer Haut vorbei. Mit dem richtigen After Shave sorgen Sie f\u00fcr eine Rasur ohne Nachspiel.\n",

The film would have crapped on all our childhoods anyway.\nThe movie was going to be computer animated in a similar way to Shrek or Toy Story, but here we\u2019re having a look at who could play the main characters in a live action flick.\nGuybrush Threepwood\nThe star of the show. The bumbling hero who goes from scrawny pirate wannabe to scrawny pirate hero.\nI would like to avoid using PoTC actors in this, but there is one who suits the part quite nicely.\nMackenzie Crook or Michael Cera or Macaulay Culkin\nElaine Marley\nThe beautiful red haired feisty love interest. In many ways she\u2019s more of a hero than Guybrush. This one is really tough to cast! An English rose with an appetite for adventure.\nMichelle Ryan or Michelle Dockery or Eliza Dushku\nLeChuck\nThe undead villain. Ghost, zombie, demon, whatever form he\u2019s in, he\u2019s big and dangerous. The most terrifying scallywag on the seven seas.\nBrian Blessed or Tim Curry\nLargo LaGrande\nOne thing I really think the special edition remakes got wrong was the characterisation of Largo LaGrande. Let\u2019s see them get it right a second time round.\nGilbert Gottfried\nVoodoo Lady\nThe Obi Wan to Guybrush\u2019s Luke, she\u2019s the mystical guide who helps the hero fulfill his destiny.\nWhoopi Goldberg or Regina Taylor\nHerman Toothrot\nCrazy hermit stranded on an island who also serves as a bit of a mentor to Threepwood. Tom Hanks could do his castaway thing again, but I\u2019d like to see this guy give it a go.\nRobin Williams\nStan\nThe fast talking salesman is a tough one to cast but there are three potentials who could do an amazing job.\nBruce Campbell or Jim Carrey or Patrick Warburton\nWally\nA little ginger guy who likes the quiet life. A nerd who secretly wishes to be a mighty adventurer too.\nSeth Green or Simon Pegg or Michael J. Fox\nMen of Low Moral Fibre\nThese guys need to make an appearance. They haven\u2019t since LeChuck\u2019s Revenge, but they\u2019re such a well loved bunch of liars.\nHank Azaria as Frank, Kyle Gass as Fred and Paul Rudd as Fin\nMurray\nIf he\u2019s a skull, then obviously it\u2019ll be a CGI or puppet so keep the original Denny Delk. If not, then perhaps..?\nAndy Serkis\nCaptain Smirk\nRussell Crowe\nOtis\nMeathook\nMuscle bound hotel owner and artist Meathook is someone that Guybrush has twice gone to in the hope he would join his crew.\nRon Perlman or Eric Allan Kramer\nKing Andr\u00e9\nThe smuggler crime lord who was almost a match for even LeChuck.\nSamuel L. Jackson\nMonkey Island\u2019s native man eaters.\nWill Smith as Red Skull, Richard Ayoade as Sharptooth and Stephen K Amos as Lemonhead\nMorgan LeFlay\nThreepwood\u2019s superfan. I\u2019m not sure she would have a role in the movie, but if she did this girl could do a great job.\nNatalie Dormer\nCaptain Dread\nOne of the friendliest (and most superstitious) guys in the Caribbean.\nMos Def\nBob\nAgain, most likely a CGI job, but this cameo would be wonderful.\nBill Murray\nHi there!

Basically, there are two types of bald heads - permanent bald head and clean shaved head.\nIn the first type i.e., permanent bald head, there will be some hair on the sides of the head, whereas in the second type, it is completely hairless (those who choose to shave off a full head of hair).\nSo, it is very important to grow a beard style that balances your face shape and size so that you could attract the eyeballs towards your beard easily. You can give your personality an extra mile by sporting a cool beard style with the perfect dressing.\nDifferent Types of Beard Styles for Bald Heads\nYou can sport any of the below facial hairstyles for a trendy look. They are\nGoatee (Full or Classic)\n#1.Goatee\nHugh Jackman, who is popularly known for his role as a Wolverine in the X-Men series has got a completely new avatar (Blackbeard) for his role in the upcoming movie 'Pan'. He is sporting a beard style called 'Goatee' with twirled mustache and a shaved head. This facial hairstyle is also known as Van Dyke.\nThere are various styles of Goatee but everything falls under two categories - full goatee and classic goatee.\nThe full goatee is often seen in bikers, corporate people, construction men, evil twins from the outside world (just kidding) etc... It suits the class people as well as the mass.Whereas the classic goatee is often seen in rock stars (people related to music niche), IT guys and a lot of youngsters.\n#2.Stubble\nThis beard style is good particularly for men with bald head (some hair on the sides of the head). The aura of the stubble is sexy.\n#3.Full Beard\nThe full beard is actually a counter to the baldness . Instead of the hair on your head, you grow a beard on the face. The full beard is an excellent choice especially, for those who crossed their 40's. This style may look traditional, but you can customize it to look modern.\nBTW, who else would look great with full beard and bald head, other than our very own Bruce Willis?\n#4.Mustache\nIf you don't like to or not comfortable sporting a beard, then you can try to grow a mustache . The mustache is one of the best options to style with a bald head. Simply, leave your mustache unshaved for 3 or 4 days and it will blend with your face.\nHope these best beard styles for bald man are inspiring.

            "85": "Tuesday, May 17, 2016\nCinema Bestius: Toy Story\nLet us all take a moment today to consider the tsunami of fun that began with this film.\n#40 \u2013 Toy Story\nToy Story started as a very different film\u2014so different that it is a miracle that we wound up with the Toy Story that was released on November 22, 1995. Pixar, which was then owned by Steve Jobs, had success with short animated films like the Oscar-winning Tin Toy. The idea was to make a feature film. Toy Story started life as a film about an antique wind-up toy and his adventures with a nasty ventriloquist dummy. Through multiple drafts, multiple screenwriters, multiple threats to shut production down, multiple visits to the recording studio for the voice cast, and multiple re-boots (literally) we have this amazing film.\nThe Plot In Brief: When humans are not around, toys are real and come to life, just as we have always suspected. Human Andy receives a new action figure for his birthday, a spaceman named Buzz Lightyear. The toy immediately becomes his favorite. Woody, a cowboy doll, was Andy\u2019s favorite toy for most of his young life. Woody tries to swallow his jealousy and welcome Buzz to Andy\u2019s bedroom, but there is a problem. Buzz does not understand that he is a toy. Buzz believes that he is a real spaceman.\nIn an uncharacteristic show of malice, Woody takes steps to eliminate Buzz. He is all too successful. He and the other toys must band together to return Buzz to Andy\u2019s bedroom. Bring that spaceman home safely!\nBeyond the groundbreaking animation, the literate scripts, and the top-flight voice talent, Pixar is to be commended for the messages that their movies impart to small children. Many children\u2019s films seem to be about farts and burps and pee-pee and poo-poo. It is easy to get a laugh from small children with those topics, believe me; I do it all the time. Witness the trailer for the upcoming Angry Birds movie, which features an extended sequence of a bald eagle micturating.\nToy Story emphasizes the importance of friendship (even with someone very different from yourself) and teamwork. Monsters, Inc. also stresses the importance of friendship\u2026 and the viability of alternative energy sources. Finding Nemo focuses on family and how terrifying independence can seem to a small child. The Incredibles shows that people who are different are special and have a right to be different. Ratatouille teaches children to never let others define them. Inside Out gives children a whole new metaphoric way to discuss their own emotions. A Bug\u2019s Life demonstrates that a viable children\u2019s film can be adapted from Kurosawa\u2019s The Seven Samurai.\nWe should all be thankful that our children are learning these important things from Pixar film. I know I am.\nDon\u2019t get me started about Toy Story 2. I have always had a love/hate relationship with Toy Story 2. On the one hand, it brings back the beloved characters from the first movie and introduces us to a brand-new character, Jesse the cowgirl. It contains the wonderful message that toys should be played with and are not to be kept \u201cmint in box\u201d or stored away as investments. I agree with that wholeheartedly. But Toy Story 2 features a villain, Al the Toy Collector, who looks exactly like me.\nTo say the least, I was both fazed and frightened by this resemblance when the film was first released and even shaved my goatee so I would look less like him. Of course, one can argue that Al is not ME; he is just a cultural stereotype of the overweight nerdy guy who never grew up. Armies of these guys can be spotted at Comic-Con. The Simpsons' \u201cComic Book Guy\u201d is one of them. It does not bother me much\u2026 anymore. These are my people.\nIn nomine Patrice, et Toys R Us, y spiritu Pixar, Amen!\nPosted by\n\"When humans are around, toys are real and come to life, just as we have always suspected.\"\n...Do I really have to point out the missing \"not\" in the first clause?\n",

Sadly, I see a lot of men these days growing beards in the wrong way, for instance I believe that if you are carrying a big hair/afro haircut, you shouldn't spot a big beard as well. I believe this is the basics and for those of you who don't want to believe the rest of the things I write here, please believe this, unless of cos you are trying to prove a point that the SUN is round in shape, which sadly we already know, no need to argue that.\nJust a quick tip if you are or trying to be a \u201cgentleman with beards\u201d, your hair and beards must not be of same size, one must be bigger than the other. If you CANNOT reduce the entire hair, then trim off the sides of the hair for a mid-skin fade and tapered sides.\u00a0\nBefore you grow a beard, it is best to find the right beard style for your face. There are some general rules on how to choose this and we will look at each face shape and the appropriate beard to go with it much later, but first let\u2019s talk about a few basics to build the foundation so you can believe without a single doubt that what you are about to do is a justifiable course. #GrowYourBeards\nMr. Kobi sporting his beards 2 sundays before this post\nHere is my Story!!\nTime now 11:45pm: 26:07:2015\nSo I worked all through Saturday night till Sunday morning and decided not to go to church this morning but rather to stay home, rest and sleep till later in the evening before going to have a hair cut in preparation for work tomorrow. I initially thought the Devil was at work, how can I miss morning service again today...didn\u2019t know God had a different plan for me.\nFast forward to 5:30pm, I was up from bed & bored, so I dressed up and drove off to church for the evening service [last service for the day]. It was a short and concise service which bordered on teachings of the Old Testament [Hardly do I hear old testament teachings these days in church]. Frankly I wasn't so much interested, so I used the opportunity to just sit and browse through my IPAD the books of the Old Testament which I haven't read a line from in over 7 years I'm sure.\nLong story cut short...I left the church at the end of the 1 hour evening service and started heading to my barbing salon within my estate to have my routine once-a-week \u201cbeard cut\u201d \u2013 I call it that cos the concentration is usually on the beard. It takes just about 5-10 minutes to wrap up my hair cut and another 45 minutes to 1 hour to \"pamper\" the beards.\u00a0\nAs I drove back, I\u00a0couldn't\u00a0help but ponder on the verse of the bible that I found\u00a0while in church earlier. It\u2019s the first time I ever knew that verse - Leviticus 19:27 existed in the bible and I was even more filled with joy and gladness when I cross referenced it with another scripture where King David commanded his people \u201cRemain in Jericho until your beards have grown and then return!\u201d, this was after one wicked King humiliated David's soldiers by shaving off their beards.\nI was happy to hear this from the Lord God himself. I felt just the same way I felt back then in high school when I found out that the Songs of Solomon was NOT just a guide book for picking up girls but actually a Book in the Bible which I could easily use to make pretty girls fall for me while quoting the scriptures at same time. I recall chapter 4 vs 1 of SOS which was my best line \u00a0in those days even though the girls I chased never had veils on and were always on either low cut or puff-puff\u00a0 hair style [Kai! Kobi!]. Funny enough, they were falling for the line from the Good Book.\n\u00b7\u00a0 Song of Solomon 4:1\n\u00a0\n\u00b7\u00a0 Leviticus 19:27\n\u00a0\n\u00b7\u00a0 2 Samuel 10:5b\nAnd the king said, \u201cRemain at Jericho until your beards have grown and then return.\u201d\nSo back at the hair salon........\n7:25pm \u2013 As I walked in, Paul greeted me \u201cEvening Boss\u201d\n7:25pm \u2013 Mr. Kobi: Evening Paul, how are you today? [as I sat down on the chair]\n7:25pm \u2013 Paul : I\u2019m alright boss!\n7:30pm \u2013 Paul : [Silence] as he started cutting my hair [Paul is my favorite barber, he knows my hair style is constant, [skin cut], however, he usually suggests beards style and have at one time refused to trim my beards based on my request, until I explained and pleaded, that I was only doing so for a job interview I had the next day]\n7:40pm: [Paul was done with the haircut and moved over to the beard management without asking me any question about what I wanted, cos he already knew]\n8:30pm: [Still total silence for the past 50 minutes, as I thought deeply about writing this article when I got home]\n8:40pm: Thanks Paul [as I paid for the service with an extra tip on top, just before leaving the salon]\nAs I left the barber's shop, while on my way to [Damascus], I pondered about these scriptures I found\u2026sorry\u2026did I say say Damascus, I meant on my way home. It was as if scales fell off my eyes, I saw a deeper meaning to these words which truly inspired me to stay up night once again to write this piece while also advising on the guide to choosing the right beard style that is suitable for different face shapes and types. Before you\u00a0criticize\u00a0this guide, ask\u00a0Abraham Lincoln.\n1.\u00a0 The Oval Face\u00a0\nMen with this shape are the luckiest, as a variety of facial hair styles\u00a0will complement this shape.\u00a0The oval face shape is considered the ideal shape and requires no special shaping to balance facial features. Do whatever you like and you'll look great.\u00a0\u00a0\n2.\u00a0 The Round Face\u00a0\nIndividuals with round faces should try facial hair styles that have the effect of making faces appear masculine and oval-shaped.\u00a0When shaping the beard for around face, go a bit longer at the chin to add length and make the face appear less round. Avoid bushy sideburns and keep the sides of the beard short. In lieu of a full beard, a goatee is often a good option for a round face.\n3.\u00a0 The Square Face\nMen with square faces should opt for styles that make their faces appear lessbox-like and more slender.\u00a0\nSimilar to shaping a beard for a round face, the beard for a square face should be shorter at the sides and longer at the chin to add length to the face. A goatee is also a good option for men with square faces.\n4.\u00a0 The Long Face\u00a0\nExactly opposite of the round face, the long face requires a beard which is fuller at the sides and shorter at the chin. The goal here is to add width to the sides and make the face appear less long. Make sure to avoid abrupt changes in length so the shaping is not obvious.\u00a0\n5.\u00a0 The Small Face\u00a0\nSmall faces require small facial hair. Larger, fuller styles will make the face get lost and appear out of proportion. Also follow the rules above for the appropriate face shape.\u00a0\n6.\u00a0 The Large Face\u00a0\nSince the face is large, any small facial hair or beard will appear out of proportion and make the face appear bigger. Keep the beard fuller and the mustache larger. Also follow the rules above for the appropriate face shape.\nTHE BEST BEARD STYLES FOR BALD MEN\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHere are my best selection which I'm sure you must have heard about:\n1. Short Trimmed Beard\nThis is similar to just having a carefully shaped \u201cstubble\u201d look in which there are clearly defined lines and any stray hairs are picked off. The difference is that the hair is allowed to grow a bit longer. Regardless of your face shape, as long as you can grow a relatively full beard, this is a great style.\n2. Manicured Stubble\nThis is a good look if you have thick, dark facial hair. All you have to do is grow out your beard for around five days to a week and then trim it down close until it\u2019s all stubble. You will appear well-groomed rather than sloppy, yet will still appear casual and masculine. It works well with all types of faces.\n3. Classic Goatee\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo there you have it. These are the best styles for bald men. Even if you\u2019re not quite clean shaven, yet like to keep your hair short and tight, these styles will be good for you as well.\nGENTLEMEN WITH BEARDS I KNOW #BeardGang #BeInspired\nOk Gentlemen, I sincerely hope I\u2019ve been able to inspire a lot of you today to start growing your beards and most importantly choosing a beard style that is suitable for your face shape. One thing I must leave you with is this: Growing\u00a0a beard\u00a0takes patience, and you must resist the urge to shave it off when the temptations comes knocking. Cos it surely will.\nThanks as always, for reading.

My gran after 50+ years of chain smoking just simply stopped. She says she had no problem, just didn't feel like spending to money anymore. I smoke about 5 cigs a day since the age of 13 and still struggling to quit.\nIMHO it is all about desire and willpower.  I, too, smoked from the time I was 13, and did it for 25 years.  I tried to quit many times, and mostly just got hooked on nicotine gum/lozenges instead for a few months at a time.  Finally, a few years ago, the motivation and environment matched up and I said \"screw this.\" Smoke-free ever since, and while I will probably always be super-sensitive to the smell of a nice burning tobacco leaf, I really am done with it.  Good luck with your own battle.\nSimilar to the situation with the 30,000 calorie lady, I don't care if people smoke or not.  You know it's unhealthy; it's your right to be that way.  It's none of my business... until it starts affecting me, via pitching in for your eventual treatment or having butts thrown at me or onto my property.\nMiranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom\nPhatpat\nI'm still wondering about battery life.\nAnd they list the wired as Windows compatible, but not the new bluetooth version. Any reason it wouldn't work on Windows?\norlando bloom\nmatte screen option or fail.\nGiven that the option is available for the macbook pro, I'd guess the imacs will get them.\nOrlando Bloom\nApr 22, 04:26 PM\nI think it's ugly. And after looking at it for a while I discovered why: There's no symmetry. Maybe it would look better if the non-glass areas on the top and bottom had the same height. Like all iDevices so far have.\nFurtermore, I'm not too sure about the lack of a border around the screen. I think the screen needs to have a frame. Looks better, and your fingers won't be covering the screen when you hold it.\nAn optical home button that recognizes gestures sounds totally awesome, though.\nApr 29, 07:29 AM\nInteresting. Well I'm sure it's not a big deal. Why are people complaining over .2mm?\nOrlando Bloom Madrid spain\nJul 24, 10:22 PM\nSome Apple patents are just \"out there\" and don't sound useful in practice. I never expect to see them in a product.\nBut THIS sounds actually very useful--the problem of whether a keyboard hogs the screen or not is solved, etc. etc.\nApple's hiring says they're serious about touch computing. For an iPod? For a Mac? And when? I can't wait to find out!\nSorry posted wrong picture! I will edit in a minute\nOrlando Bloom\nNov 3, 10:24 AM\nI signed up for this months ago, may have to do so again since I didn't get a reply yet, my guess is that Fusion will be (somewhat) better and (slightly) more expensive than Parallels\nLOL...Right after Launcher Pro 3.\nOrlando Bloom Happy His New\nArchaicRevival\nApr 22, 09:43 AM\nThat's completely fine with me. LTE speeds aren't really LTE speeds anyway. Even Verizon which does have the fastest LTE falls short of at least 50% of the actual LTE speeds. It's all false advertising anyway :)\nJul 25, 08:35 AM\nWouldn't it be \"non-touch?\"\nNone-touch doesn't sound right.. That's the Japanese/Chinese for you. Lost in translation.. how about just plain 'ol touchless :)\nkerr and orlando bloom at\niqwertyi\nhttp://i971.photobucket.com/albums/ae198/Ben_Dixon/003.jpg\nDon't worry, your vision is fine. One of the wheels is for a friend at university.\nHow are these?  I'm looking for a wheel for F1 2010 and GT5 (when they both come out).\nI was about to purchase the G25 but these may do as well.\nDoes it have paddles?\nApr 26, 02:59 PM\nDrive arrays can easily exceed 10 Gbps - even with spinning hard drives.  Today a 2 SSD drive RAID 0 array can hit 10 Gbps with consumer-grade drives.\nSingle drives faster than TBolt already exist - 12 Gbps SSD drive (http://www.fusionio.com/products/iodriveduo/) 48 Gbps SSD drive (http://www.fusionio.com/products/iodriveoctal/).\nTBolt devices haven't even hit the market, but TBolt is already too slow for many uses.\nAh, I completely forgot about PCI-Express based SSDs. I kept thinking about 6Gbps SATA SSDs.\nAlso, \"SSD drive\" is redundant :).\nOrlando Bloom\nI wonder how Thunderbolt will interact with the graphics card.\nI expect that the video signals (DisplayPort) go from the graphics card back through the PCI bus to the TB chip and then out through the TB ports to the monitor. So when you upgrade the graphics card, it works (thinking of computers with replaceable PCI cards here, e.g. a Mac Pro with TB). But this will likely require the support of the graphics card manufacturers, so we have cards that are \"compatible\" with TB...?\nPresumably one can still use the graphics cards' own video-out ports too.\nGuess we'll see.\nwell TB seems to be add on to DP port. So VIDEO may work with a added in card and a voodoo 1 like loop back cable.  But you don't TB tied to on board video and what about AMD / sever / upper mid - high end intel boards / other boards that don't have chipset / cpu based video. Some sever boards have on board pci based video.\nmacFanDave\nJul 21, 02:44 PM\nThey're behind Gateway in number of units shipped. Gateway produces and ships more units than Apple.\nMichael, read shawnce's message #61.  It's exactly how I wanted to reply to your statement, only better.\nAbout market share, there is an optimal level, I believe.  Too low and the issue of third-party applications and peripherals becomes a problem.  However, if Apple's marketshare gets too high, there could be some anti-trust problems.\nLet's face it: Apple is a monopoly, but with such a small market share, it is a monopoly that we have freely chosen to deal with.  We Mac consumers cannot go to the DOJ and claim we have no alternatives (just because your alternatives suck doesn't mean you don't have them.)  If Apple were wildly successful and exceeded this threshold market share, their business model may be interfered with by the government.\n10% should be far below that threshold.\nMiranda Kerr And Orlando Bloom\nMacNut\nMar 1, 09:08 PM\nI hope the real Charlie Sheen is as funny as the fake one on Twitter.\nKnightWRX\nApr 12, 06:57 AM\nTB was envisioned by Apple and then handed off to Intel for development and implementation.\nCitation needed.\nBeaverman3001\nApr 17, 07:07 PM\nIdk how the CPU would be considerably faster than a 2.13 GHz core2duo.\nThe only bright side to this upgrade is the fact that battery might last extra :30 -1:00 hour.\nDoes this mean we might see thunderbolt in the new MBA? (which i dont even care)\nIf the CPU processing is really that faster than the 2.13 I would like to know since I ordered an MBA yesterday :P\nClock speed isn't everything. The sandy bridge i5 should be considerably faster. With that said, buying a MBA to do intensive things with is questionable to begin with.\nOrlando Bloom\nDec 4, 12:36 PM\nwhat does not kill us makes us stronger however this is a wake-up call :eek:\nGo Apple kick but :D\njohnnymg\nApr 22, 04:17 PM\nIf true, there are going to be HUGE lines for this.\nCQd44\nSamsung gets on my nerves.\nI wonder how many other users think this solely because Apple doesn't like them.\nkainjow\nNov 3, 10:10 AM\nThis is what will get me switching to VMware vs Parallels, multicore support in virtualization!\nThat will work nicely on the Mac Pros.

I got behind the product because I know it looks good.\nAndrew Staniland, left, Geoff Thomas and Daz Day, right, have all had the \u00a32,000 treatment done\n'Going bald didn\u2019t particularly bother me but there are guys out there who are literally suicidal about it'\n'Stars like Wayne Rooney, tweeting about having a hair transplant, have really helped the cause and encouraged people to face it head-on.\n'But not everybody has \u00a325,000 to spend and this is a great affordable alternative.'\nThe technique, which costs an average of \u00a32,000, was developed by Ian Watson, who founded HIS Hair after he developed alopecia in his mid-twenties, following the tragic death of his 32 year-old brother Paul, from cancer.\nIn desperation, he asked Paul\u2019s widow, Ranbir Rai-Watson to find the finest pen she could get to draw dots onto his scalp, hoping to emulate the look of a \u2018cropped\u2019 haircut.\nThe process is a scalp pigmentation technique in the form of tattooing a cropped 'buzz' hair style onto the head\nThe ink came off in the shower but Ian, now 42, and mother of one Ranbir, 41, knew their \u2018crazy idea\u2019 could become a successful business concept.\nAfter years of intensive research, they began honing the MHT technique alongside some of the world\u2019s best hair loss experts, as well as semi-permanent make-up artists in Harley Street, London and Melbourne, Australia.\nAnd a decade later the Birmingham-based company is opening clinics across Europe and the US.\nThe technique works by applying different shades of  specifically blended pigments to the scalp to replicate the size, shape  and density of micro hairs\nSaid Adee: \u201cThe crop will always be fashionable.\nThe revolutionary equipment used for the treatment\n'This is a great permanent, non-surgical option that can disguise everything from male- pattern\nbaldness to receding hair lines and scars on your head.\n'I thought losing my hair didn\u2019t bother me but even I felt younger and more confident afterwards.\n'And it looks so natural, most people don\u2019t even know I\u2019ve had it done.'\nAccording to statistics 10 million  men in the UK currently suffer from hair loss -with 50 per cent affected  by male patterned baldness by the age of 50.\nA quarter go bald as young as 30 and by 60 as many as two-thirds are showing signs of it.\nFor many its more traumatic than going bust - or never finding the love of their life.\nAnd British men will worry about its  onset more than anyone else in Europe, even though 75 per cent believe  there\u2019s nothing they can do about it.\nShare or comment on this article\nMost watched News videos\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\nMore top stories\nDON'T MISS\n'Couldn't ask for a better present': Birthday girl Binky Felstead shares first glimpse of her baby daughter as she brings her home from the hospital\n'It makes you creative' Tamara Ecclestone discusses sharing her marital bed with daughter Sophia, three... as she vows to continue breastfeeding\n'I'm embracing my body and its changes': Ashley James poses in her lingerie for sizzling snap as she reveals her favourite part of her figure is her 'thigh creases'\nOlivia Newton-John's daughter Chloe Lattanzi criticised as 'unhealthy' after sharing a photo of herself looking VERY slender in a crop top Posed with a cigarette\n'You're too skinny': Megan McKenna sparks concern as she bares 'visible ribs' in bikini snap... yet devoted defenders BLAST critics for body shaming'\nShish kebab, chicken bravas with garlic aioli and calamari with seasoned rice: Why eating healthily this summer just got a WHOLE lot more fun\u00a0 SPONSORED\n'I couldn't be happier for them': Made in Chelsea's Ollie Locke swoons over new parents Binky Felstead and Josh Patterson in heartfelt Instagram post\n'The love I have for her is unconditional': Amy Childs posts sweet snap cradling daughter Polly... after confirming shock split from boyfriend Bradley Wright\n'I'd snog him': BB's Marnie Simpson admits to having the hots for Kieran Lee... as she blasts Kayleigh Morris in brutal Diary Room chat\nDemi Rose Mawby exhibits her eye-popping cleavage and voluptuous derriere in sexy snaps from idyllic Greek getaway Tyga's rumoured ex\u00a0\nFrom Hollyoaks to Hollywood!

            "29": "He's the music producer with a magic touch and years of hits and Grammy Awards under his belt, but Clive Davis had a rare flop yesterday when he appeared to try to cover up his bald patch.\nLooking in fine fettle for 79 years of age, Davis need not have gone to the trouble of the attempted camouflage - which appeared to be courtesy of spray on hair.\nThe Sony bigwig was attending the Esquire Apartment Benefit Event Hosted by City of Hope in Brooklyn, New York, when the odd 'do' was spotted.\u00a0\nMusic man: Clive Davis attended the Esquire Apartment Benefit Event Hosted by City of Hope in Brooklyn yesterday, and the 79-year-old seemed to have turned to spray on hair to try and cover his bald patch.\u00a0\nIt was an odd move for a man of his stature, who surely has a huge team of advisors.\nDavis is on first name terms with the likes of Sean Combs, Barry Manilow and Bruce Springsteen.\n'I still call him Puffy,' Davis says of Combs. 'It might be P. Diddy or whatever the name is these days, but [to me] he's Puffy.'\nAs Chief Creative Officer for Sony Music he's also worked with Aretha Franklin, Carlos Santana, Whitney Houston, and Alicia Keys.\nMain man: Davis looked dapper until he turned around, that is\nA graduate of Harvard Law School, Davis also found his way into the Rock 'n' Roll hall of fame.\n'I do it 'cause I get great pleasure out of it,' he told NY1 'not because I need to keep proving myself.'\nHe's  famed for taking risks, when he signed 70s' great Santana in the late  90s' it was considered a nostalgic mistake, but the resulting album,  Supernatural, went on to win nine Grammy Awards.\nRELATED ARTICLES\nHe also signed tragic Janis Joplin in 1968.\nHe told the Piece of My Heart singer: 'You and I are connected now, we are an intimate part of each other\u2019s life now.'\n'And  she used the common four-letter street term for us to get together,' he  added, 'more intimately than the signing of a contract, but I  respectfully declined with a smile and a big hug.'\nOnly two years after he signed Joplin, she died of a heroin overdose.\n'I never knew that she was doing anything but drinking Southern Comfort and Jack Daniels,\" he has said.

            "35": "For many folks, premature baldness is a hereditary condition that people haven\u2019t any control over, and in the current fast-paced world, the sort of lifestyle we lead doesn\u2019t help either. The primary culprits are actually stress, poor nutrition, and uneven sleeping patterns.\nThe known fact is, hair loss enables you to look more your actual age, impacting you and knocking your confidence psychologically. Hair restoration is the very best treatment for these nagging problems and can help you restore nice hair, plus your confidence. Two of the very most popular hair transplants will be the FUE and FUT, which I\u2019ll make clear in more detail below.\nListed below are just 4 known reasons for what hair transplants can do for your confidence:\nAppearance\nWearing wigs, caps, or using non permanent solutions for hair restoration is almost always a complete waste of money. When these kinds of solutions don\u2019t work, the problem tends to worsen. Therefore, having hair that keeps growing which is natural can have a significant positive psychological effect on our lives.\nHair transplant is the one proven and everlasting treatment for overcoming baldness. If you think that getting a hair transplant would be a \u2018life changer\u2019, you\u2019re not wrong. People always feel and look younger, which boosts their confidence.\nRecovery\nFUE transplants are only minimally invasive, and patients tend to recover very quickly. The FUE procedure only leaves little round scars that are almost competely inivisible to the average person. Furthermore, using this process means that patients don\u2019t need to have any nasty stiches removed, so patients can go back to work the very next day.\nAfter the hair has been transplanted, friends and family and colleagues will never be in a position to distinguish that any surgery has occurred. From your own barber or hair stylist even, they\u2019ll never notice.\nCareer\nWith either hair transplant method you select, you\u2019ll develop a boost in self-confidence as well as self-esteem, which you\u2019ll notice in every day interactions; business and social. This can be of particular importance for those employed in representative occupation and celebrities that are constantly in the general public eye. Read model Calum Bests story here .\nAny Hair Style\nIn case your self-esteem has suffered because you think hair transplants are suitable for only people that have short hair or only people that have long hair, then this definitely isn\u2019t the situation.\nA FUE hair transplant is another advancement in the treating of hair loss. Having a U-FUE hair transplant, the U simply means unshaven or undetectable.\nWith an FUE hair transplant , many people think it is daunting as only an extremely small portion of the trunk or side of the scalp is shaved to get the donor hair.\nBut with a U-FUE transplant, this is eliminated entirely; so that it is ideal for people that have any hairstyles. Patients will keep their original hair in the same length and style, after and during the procedure.\nThrough the use of modern techniques and equipment, combined with assistance of experienced and qualified professionals, hair transplant ensures natural growth. Once hair starts to grow, they\u2019ll never fallout. These technologies have been changing the lives of men and women by bringing some positive energy to the aging process, which is generally full of sadness and despair.\nPublished on July 29, 2016.\nComment\nComment Rules: Keep it civil, and please do not use your site URL in either your name or the comment text.

I think it looks fucking sweet.  I don't really give a fuck who likes it or not, but girls seem to react a lot better to is.  Beards are more manly than clean shaven.  The main reason I keep a bull beard is because I have a weak chin; the beard hides this and makes me SIGNIFICANTLY better looking.  If you have a weak jawline or chin then you should grow a beard.\n04-02-2015 10:18 AM\nThe following 1 user Likes travolta's post:1 user Likes travolta's post\nIf you want to grow a huge beard but don't want to look like a hobo, get yourself a stiff-bristled brush and brush your beard once everyday, ideally starting just after it gets past the stubble stage.  The brushing helps your beard hair to grow in one direction so it looks naturally more tidy.  If you waited awhile to start brushing, trim off the wild ends after you get enough new growth that's all going the same way.\nThe brushing has the added bonus of getting a lot of dead skin off your face.\n\"Who cares what I think?\" - Jeb Bush\n04-02-2015 10:40 AM\nI've been keeping a full beard for..i think close to two years now, and i don't think it's gonna change anytime soon. The history of the beard is that basically i had no reason to shave for long periods of time, i was very lazy..and it got tiring to have people ask me once every two weeks if i'm growing out a beard, because i would neglect it for weeks and then shave, and then neglect again and shave, etc. Now I feel like it's a part of who I am. What's interesting is that in these 2 years i actually shaved it off 2 times. That's because i found myself longing for that clean shaven or 5'o clock look. And every time I shaved, i actually noticed fewer IOI's from girls and that people seemed to give me more shit..like because they found me less intimidating and mature probably.\nHere's a few tips about growing your beard out and wearing it like a boss:\n> If you'll let your beard grow out at some point you'll have to trim it down and it will feel hard to do so, reason being is that you start getting pleasure in seeing how big your beard can get or just used to it being big..but I found that in both business and game it's better to keep it on the short side rather than on the long side. What I do now is that I let my barber choose the right size for it every time I get my cut. He always seems to take it a bit shorter than I'd like but I end up getting a lot of compliments and love it too in the end.\n> The beard, I found, can give you some real benefits in social interactions..because people will perceive you as more intimidating, confident and mature.\n> Its a good time and money saver. Not having to spend shit on razor blades, shaving cream, moisturizer, not having to shave for 10 minutes every day..etc. This all adds up significantly when you consider the frequency during the year.\n> When deciding on whether or not to grow your beard out don't obsess over what you think girls will think about it. Fact of the matter is the beard will eventually become a part of who you are, and by changing this aspect about yourself you're only slightly changing what type of girls will be most attracted to you. Fact is that some girls don't like you for some other shit anyway, like what type of shoes you wear or haircut, while others will love those aspects about you. And for the record, in my experience I found that younger girls love beards more..and that's fine by me.\n04-02-2015 10:41 AM\nI think beards are like long hair.

Don't put anything on your beard that wasn't formulated for beards only, or the skin underneath is going to get dried out and it will be really uncomfortable.  If your beard itches, the first thing you should consider is not washing it for a few days.  Any body wash or shampoo is going to be bad for your facial skin.\n\"Who cares what I think?\" - Jeb Bush\n04-02-2015 11:10 AM\n(04-02-2015 10:57 AM)jamaicabound Wrote: \u00a0\nI think beards are like long hair.

During school times I usually had a chin strap, then I've upgraded it to the Tony Stark beard:\nlooks snazzy and isn't a goatee. One chick even called me out that I look like Iron Man\nthe beard ages me into the early 30s region, but I don't mind, I always looked older. It's actually my master plan, walk around with a beard till I'm 30 then shave it off and I'll become 20 again. I feel kinda goofy, uncomfortable and naked without some kind of beard though. But I think I'll never be able to get a big bushy beard though. Not for lack of trying, but the scraggyness and itchiness when it starts to become long is making me crazy, so I can't endure it and just trim it.\nAnd Roosh said it best, fashion styles come and go, so do what you like. When I was in school I was the only one with a beard, got some jokes about it (but in good humor) here and there, father said I look like a muslim terrorist and that I should shave it off. Then at some point I got bored and shaved it, turns out everyone got used to it and got some \"awww where'd the beard go?\" comments. Now the pendulum has swung completely in the other direction and I can barely find 1 person walking around who doesn't have some kind of scruff going on. Even friends who were lolling at the beard during school times now have facial hair, and even longer and bushier ones than me. Point is, styles come and go (hipsters almost ruined the whole beard thing for me), but you can remain consistent in what you like\nBeware of rocking thie chindicator goatee when you're fat and have no jaw, everybody knows why you have it!\n(This post was last modified: 04-04-2015 05:24 AM by INegUThenLol .)\n04-04-2015 05:04 AM\nI can honestly speak to this trend with true to life information and not specualtion.\nI grew a giant trendy civil war hipster beard about six months ago and got one of the ultra close sidepart extreme fade combos to go along with it as part of ditching my long held surf look. I've actually been meaning to do a full post on \"being trendy\" since the bar these days is so low.\nJust like this basically but with more fade.  You've seen them around.\nHoly shit.  Having previously had shoulder lenght surfer hair I'm aware that strong looks have groupies, but let me be the first to tell you that the \"beardies\" can be insane provided you do in fact have a giant well groomed \"it beard\".\n[b]The first thing I noticed is that there isn't a specific type of woman that is prone to being a beardy. I've had sorority girls grabbing at me and it just as frequently as your coffee shop hispter set.[/b]  I've also had both groups tell me they hate beards so its one of those stranges things that you just never know.  I think for some men it shifts the focus of the face to their eyes and in my case this is a plus.\nWith the giant full beard and side part just about to fully tip in the mainstream I can only imagine what the next two years will have in store.\nSome other frindge benefits of having a giant well groomed beared ( I keep stressing this because you beard needs to be a trendy fashion accesory. No girl is going to hop out of her clothes for some scragly neck beard shit)  is that you suddenly look more manly and other guys start to assume your more of a badass.

Picture: Marcella Leith\nThe Art Fund has ended its three-month search for a new leader by announcing the appointment of Turner Prize Chairman and Tate Britain Director Stephen Deuchar.\nThe 52-year-old specialist in 18th century British art, who played an instrumental role in the foundation of Tate Britain nine years ago during more than a decade at the institution, will take over from long-serving predecessor David Barrie in January 2010.\n\"I am simply thrilled to have been offered the opportunity to direct the UK's leading art charity,\" said a delighted Deuchar. \"Its vital support of art galleries and museums across the UK, and the role it plays in galvanising support for the visual arts in Britain, make it a truly exceptional organisation. I cannot wait to start work.\"\nArt Fund Chairman David Verey said his new charge was \"passionate about art and artists\" and \"a great arts professional.\" \"It is wonderful that he will be joining as our new Director,\" he added. \"We are all very excited for the future.\"\nDeuchar spent 12 years as a curator at the National Maritime Museum before being appointed to the Tate in 1998, overseeing a 60% increase in visitors since 2001.\n\"I am very proud of my time at Tate Britain and to have been entrusted with the task of being its founding Director,\" he reflected, crediting his \"inspirational\" colleagues. \"The Art Fund represents an important new chapter for me and an exhilarating challenge.\"\nAll tags\n",

Learn more .\nThe Huffington Post Canada \u00a0|\u00a0 By Chloe Tejada\nAdd enhanced risk of premature balding to the list of illnesses and indignities faced by diminutive men of European descent, according to a new study.\n\"It seems that men with a relatively shorter body height have a higher chance of losing their hair,\" University of Bonn professor Stefanie Heilmann-Heimbach, lead author of the study published Wednesday, told AFP.\n\"Our data indicates that some of the genes involved in baldness are associated, on average, with shorter stature.\"\nEarlier research has shown that men with so-called male pattern baldness are also statistically more likely to suffer from heart disease and prostate cancer, though the added risk is slight.\nReduced body size and early onset of puberty are also linked with loss of hair for men.\nSome of the same genes that regulate human height, it seems, also play a role in the emergence of these conditions and diseases.\nThe study, published in Nature Communications, identified 63 genetic variations \"that increase the risk of premature hair loss,\" Heilmann-Heimbach said.\nThe researchers did not set out to find a link with height, she added.\nNor did they quantify the relative risk of baldness associated with different statures.\n\"Future studies that assess both hair loss and body height may be able to answer that question,\" she said by email.\nBut the statistical link was clear.\nIn men of European origin, balding usually starts in one's 30s. Up to 80 per cent of European men are affected to some extent.\nHair loss in Asians comes about a decade later, and the overall frequence is much lower, impacting 50 to 60 per cent men.\nThere is relatively little data on baldness in Africa, but male hair loss there seems even less frequent.\nSome of the gene variants uncovered in the study \"may constitute promising targets for therapeutic interventions,\" Heilmann-Heimbach said.\nAlso on HuffPost:\n\ue000\n\ue001\nThere really is no specific age men should fear. Generally, the risk of losing your hair is proportional to your age, says hair expert Dr. Alan Bauman of Bauman Medical Group in Florida. \"Hair loss can occur twenty per cent in your 20s, 30 per cent in your 30s and so on, including anytime after puberty,\" he says. According the American Hair Loss Association, by 35, two-thirds of men experience some degree of hair loss, and by the age of 50, about 85 per cent of men have significantly thinner hair.\nFor men, male pattern baldness is the most common form of hair loss, Bauman says. Thinning begins at the temple and the crown of the head. Over time, hair at the temple continues to recede, leaving you a central patch of hair at the front of the hairline and a growing bald spot at the crown. The baldness in the front will eventually catch up with the baldness in the back, leaving you a larger bald spot.\nFor men, hair loss can be triggered by dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a breakdown product of the hormone testosterone that causes miniaturization of hair follicles.\nBased on DNA from both parents, we're prone to thinning hair any time after puberty. But just because your father is bald in his 60s, does this mean you have the 'hair loss gene?' Bauman says if you're really concerned, the best way to know is to get tested \u2014 genetic tests can predict the risk of hair loss for both men and women.\nBesides genetics, things like stress, the aging process, medications, inflammation of the scalp, poor diet, smoking or poor sleeping habits can all contribute to hair loss.\nWhile there are a number of preventative treatments available like nutritional supplements or low level laser therapy, in most cases, a hair transplant is the only way to permanently restore lost follicles.\nBauman says one of the biggest mistakes people make is missing the early signs of hair loss. \"A staggering 50 per cent of hair loss can occur before it\u2019s noticeable to the human eye.\" If you are worried about losing hair, consult with a both your primary doctor and an experienced hair restoration physician \u2014 someone who specializes exclusively in the medical diagnosis, treatments and tracking of hair loss and regrowth.\n\ue002 Share\n\ue003 Tweet\nMore:\nConversations\nOptions\nLiving\nGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..\nFacebook\nHuffPost\nLiving\nTwitter\nHuffPost\nFollow\nLiving\nFollow\nPart of AOL Lifestyle\nUse this form to alert a HuffPost editor about a factual or typographical error in this story.\nNotify message\nDescribe the error here (1,000 character limit)\n* Type the words below so we know you are not a cyborg\nSign me up for The Huffington Post's Daily Brief\nThanks for your report!\n",

            "70": "Prior to the New Year I wanted to demonstrate to my audience the power of a Tulpa. I\nhad been feeling for sometime this dark sense that 2011 will be the year of sacrifice. I\nhad contemplated the method of getting this message out and I called upon a colleague\nof mine to help illustrate what I wanted to deliver. Tracy R. Twyman and I had a\ndiscussion prior to my broadcast that had me thinking of what was happening in the\nworld and how a pessimistic and narcissistic society has decided that reverse causality\nis no longer a pseudo science but a norm.\nThe world has determined that in order to fix the present they must take from some\nnebulous future and hope that all things will improve. However I was seeing that\nwhat was being done was the elimination of future generations. It will be the culling\nof thousands of future children that will be denied life because of poverty, eugenics\ndirectives, and war.\nWhile there seemed to be the critique that this was an overt attempt to illustrate the\nperils of overspending, there was more to my argument than just child sacrifice. It was\nalso an argument that I proposed to demonstrate the consensus opinion of a future that\nby all intent will not transpire. That the future generations will not survive because it is\nknown in secret that the thought of self destruction has already begun to take hold.\nWith all of the negative eschatology and dispensationalist rhetoric we will begin to see\na self fulfilling prophecy manifest and with it, all of the monsters and egregores that are\nassociated with such thoughts.\nIn the article 2011: Childermas there were many memes that were touched upon and\nthere was an effort to create the understanding that when sacrifices are made and blood\nis spilled the human collective generates a massive amount of powerful thoughts and\nanxieties. The erratic thoughts change people and soon we see things transpire in\nour various realities that have heretofore been considered hypothetical. Much of the\nway we see the world has been programmed into us by \u2018authorities\u201d and a government\nwith no moral compass and many people are forced to eliminate anything that does\nnot fit a \u201cstandard\u201d that they have created. When lives are lost and tears are shed the\nblame will be tossed around amongst the religious and political and it will then lose its\nmeaning.\nTwyman and I were trying to explain that words and thoughts will have more power\nand that there is a sense that the veil is thinning and that negative ideas planted into\nthe fertile ether will lead to the deaths of many innocent children. As we witness the\nsuffering, imposed poverty and death we will become unwitting initiates in the blood\nrites. Many people will not care that the blood of the innocent will be used to feed us\nand feed into a monster that we have constructed by our own dark psychic construct.\nThis will bait us into an enslaved apocalypse where we will already accept the so called\nmark of the beast because of our participation in the ritual of victimhood.\nIn the nearly sixteen years I have been investigating the paranormal and going about\nmy various Fortean affairs, I have consumed many, books, articles, movies and\ntelevision specials. Sometimes it is hard to recall from memory who said what and\nwhich ideas they have set in motion. A lot of what I see and talk about comes from the\npast and now it seems that I am evolving into a soul who seeks out and often shapes\nand approximates future events.\nI see myself challenging consensus attitudes that all together seem to be over political,\nover anxious and many times over religious. To many people it sends a message that\nI am not optimistic. I believe that there is a future to be had, and enjoyed however I\nam struggling with the notion that too much negative programming has entered the\ncollective unconscious opening the door for something I call \u201cpychochondria.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a word I made up to describe the state of mind where you don\u2019t know whether or not to be vigilant or paranoid. While we are slowly developing this condition, we become\nmore susceptible to whims of our puppet masters and at the same time we question\nwhether or not they are sane or even aware of what is best for us as a collective.\nThis is why it is important to take back the freedom you have as being an individual and\nnot a co-dependent operative for a \u201ccult\u201d that seems to be growing and thriving within\nthe boundaries of politics and religious fanaticism.\nEspecially in times where many people are convincing themselves that the end times\nare upon us. We are being kept in a state of consensus anger, grief and victimization.\nMental health specialists had warned us that in the aftermath of 9/11 fatigue we would\nwitness the lashing out between those who want to tell their otherwise \u201cpatriotic\u201d counterparts to get over themselves and start living again and those who are rekindling their hate against their dispositions.\nThe government has done nothing to set into motion a healing process and so the\ncollective mind continues to deteriorate and it seems that if you step out of the madness and see it with objectivity you can pretty well determine what the future holds.\nI am noticing that the world is on a collision course with its mirror opposite and all\nthings that we thought were true are suddenly changing their meaning and validity. It is\nfascinating to watch these things unravel.\nPeople can argue over whether or not the things I say and do are psychic in nature.\nSome believe I am a Satanist, or a black arts practitioner but I can safely tell them that I am just a person who seems to have some kind of apophenia where I can see patterns\nand approximate the future from random recollections of history and present events.\nThere are many others who say that perhaps I am crazy and that they don\u2019t see the\npatterns and think that I prattle on about nonsense. It seems that as I grow older I\nam becoming more inclined to address those who are awake; I am no longer in the\nbusiness of waking people up. There are some people who have been hitting their\nsnooze alarms for far too long. They literally are slowing down our potentiality for\nprogress.\nThey reject the fact that we have powers far greater than anyone can comprehend.\nMany people do not realize that we live in a world of Tulpas and with all of the theories,\ninterpretations and the worlds that exist with our world Tulpas, or if you will, thought\nforms transform and mutate their way into becoming words, actions and manifestations\nthat we did not expect to show up in our reality.\nThoughts resonate at frequency, they can be exchanged in many ways and when a\nthought form is all consuming with the consensus we begin to see peculiarities take\nshape. If the consensus can agree that peace and tranquility is all around us and they\ncan picture puppies chasing, balls, ballerinas and cart wheeling clowns then the world\nwould eventually transform into a fun fair.\nThere are many people who say that they desire peace, love and tranquility and they\nnever achieve it to their satisfaction.\nIt is because they don\u2019t realize that desires are only part of what it takes to see them\nmanifest. I struggle with these things myself. We all do. We are trying to regain our\npersonal powers as we are being bombarded with attitudes and programming that\nstifle that power. At times it seems more convenient to just go back to sleep and hit the\nsnooze bar repeatedly until we no longer have the will to open our eyes.\nPositive desires have to be generated first in your collective unconscious in order for\nthem to manifest. I argue that the collective unconscious of the world has been so\nbombarded with apocalyptic and negative energy that it is becoming easier to predict\nthe outcome of such core programming.\nI can prove that Tulpas are real and that the results of such Tulpas create a psychic\nconstruct that can rip a hole in the universe and manifest right before our eyes.\nThe world is not only populated by upright walking human beings and animals. It\nis populated and under the control of various thought forms. There is within those\nthoughts a great deal of resonant noise and if you listen carefully to the noise there is\nalways something that finds a way to surface, manifest and renders consequence.\nThat is why as Karl Jung had warned, we must strive to avoid those \u201cShadow\narchetypes\u201d that creep into our collective unconscious. They undermine everything\nwe set out to accomplish. How we see ourselves is how we see the world and if the\ncollective unconscious is sending you a warning you must pay attention and be vigilant.\nDire apocalyptic prophecies are no longer prophecy. They are apocalyptic blue prints for\ndismantling civilization and people are revering them because they are blinded by their\nown interpretations and their opinion that they are allegedly inspired by God.\nWhen a shadow archetype manifests it confronts us with the truth about ourselves.\nDuring a Ground Zero Show that aired On January 2nd 2011 I was fascinated by the\nclaims of people having simultaneous dreams about a shadow archetype known as\nthe \u201cgrinning man.\u201d I had read on several websites that there were reports of people\ndreaming of a strange entity that was tall and slender man with a bald head, no\neyebrows, and blank stare with a foolish grin. I decided that perhaps I could ask my\naudience if they had dreamed or had ever dreamed of such a man.\nThe phone bank at the studio was overloaded with calls of people who had seen the\nbald grinning man in their dreams. Some had reported seeing him in their rooms;\nothers saw him pushing a baby carriage. There was a story of the bald, grinning man\ntransforming into a bird who wanted to devour a child.\nThese calls were all recorded and were fascinating to me. Either it was all mass\nhysteria or people all over were dreaming of this evil grinning bald man with no\neyebrows that had the ability to shape shift and harm children. The bird image was also\nsomething that raised my attention because the \u201cgrinning man\u201d archetype has also been\nassociated with Mothman the dark winged creature that is an omen of destruction and\ndeath. I had read a story about a large \u201cbutterfly\u201d that had been seen in the sky over\nLos Angeles and had determined that something was manifesting that would not be\npleasant.\nI immediately wrote a supplemental article about the image of Mothman and the Demon\nPazuzu. Pazuzu was the demon of the air and was believed to be the controller of all\nflying things and some fish because of his dominion over the marsh and wetlands.\nI received a phone call from Olav Phillips of the anomalies network and he had informed\nme that there was a strange event happening in the world. He was explaining that birds\nwere dying in Arkansas. I thought at first that bird die offs happen all the time, but it\nwas uncanny that my listeners were dreaming of the \u201cgrinning man\u201d who represented\ndeath and people were seeing a winged entity in California that looked similar to a\nMesopotamian demon of the air named Pazuzu. Pazuzu was known for bringing\nplague, killing birds and fish and leaving in his wake pestilence and locusts. As I was\npreparing my show for Sunday there was a tragedy that happened in Arizona. On\nJanuary 8th 2011 during a morning rally with Democratic congresswoman Gabrielle\nGiffords a gunman broke through the crowd and began shooting. Twenty people\nwere shot] six of them fatally. All but 9 year old Christina-Taylor Green died at the\nscene of the shooting. She was later pronounced dead and the news of her death was\nannounced on January 9th, 2011.\nGiffords was shot in the head at point blank range and miraculously survived.\nAs the news unfolded prior to my Ground zero program I had already set aside time to\ntalk about a number of things that I thought needed to be addressed about a story that\nbirds and fish were dying.\nThe case of the Tucson fatal shootings seemed a bit paranormal and there were many\noddities that I was seeing. Christina Green\u2019s death was exceptionally troubling because\nit was reported that she was born on 9/11/01 and the report of her death and her special\nbirth date was seen splashed in newspapers on 01/9/11. The synchronicity screamed\nout to me that some sort of dark ritual had been performed prior to the shootings.\nThe 22 year old shooter, Jared lee Loughner was called a loner, a pothead, a liberal, a\ncommunist, and a tea party member. He became a political pawn for both the left and\nright wing.\nNo one even bothered to say that Loughner was a man who had many demons buried\ndeep in his unconscious mind. He had developed a dark mental illness that friends and\nrelatives say was unbearable.\nHe would often talk about babies being used as bombs and other strange and bloody\ntales. The New York daily news also reported that there was an altar in the suspect\u2019s\nback yard where a skull was placed surrounded by candles and orange peels. There\nwas speculation that some sort of \u201csatanic \u2018ritual was performed before he went on his\nshooting spree,\nThen an interesting turn of events took place. One that can be argued validates the\nidea that negative Tulpa\u2019s can happen and when they do the monster that is buried in\nthe unconscious mind shows up when you least expect it.\nIn what was called an act of political character assassination by right wing, a poster\nthat was on Sarah Palin\u2019s website had gotten a lot of attention before she took it down.\nIt was a poster or graphic that showed that Gabrielle Giffords was on Sarah Palin\u2019s\nhealthcare \u201chit list.\u201d\nThe poster showed a United States map with several targeted areas with cross hair\nillustrations like those seen in a gun scope. The scoped targets were allegedly Palin\u2019s\npolitical enemies and Gabrielle Giffords was one of them.\nThe others On Her infamous health care vote hit list were democrats Ann Kirkpatrick\n(Ariz.), Harry E. Mitchell (Ariz.), John Salazar (Colo.), Betsy Markey (Colo.), Allen Boyd\n(Fla.), Suzanne M. Kosmas (Fla.), Baron P. Hill (Ind.), Earl Pomeroy (N.D.), Charlie\nWilson (Ohio), John Boccieri (Ohio), Kathy Dahlkemper (Pa.), Christopher Carney (Pa.),\nJohn M. Spratt, Jr. (S.C.), Tom Perriello (Va.), Alan B. Mollohan (W.Va.), and Nick J.\nRahall II (W.Va.).\nWhile the media went into frenzy over the idea that perhaps the poster influenced the\nshooter, I posted the picture stating that this could have initiated a Tulpa or thought\nform in similarity to what is called \u201csympathetic magic.\u201d Some websites had concluded\nthat Sarah Palin was a witch and that \u201cintent\u201d sent out into the ether and the collective\nthought of groups like the tea party may have caused or at least contributed to horrible\nshooting.\nWhile it can be dismissed that this was the case it was a grim coincidence and a\nparanormal thought form that unfortunately led to reality. The idea of a hit list and using\nterms like \u201cDon\u2019t retreat, re-load\u201d reinforced the resolve and with millions of people\nsharing the same thought it can be looked at as a collective meme that creates an\negregore or autonomous manifestation.\nPalin had realized that this graphic was in bad form and had it immediately removed.\nShe sent out a press release saying that the so called cross hair pictures were simply\nsurveyor scopes and that she stated that she had been unfairly singled out.\nThis of course was a lie because of her use of terms like \u201cdon\u2019t retreat, reload\u201d in order to prove her point.\nCoincidentally the shooter, Jared Loughner was tackled after he attempted to reload\nhis gun after firing the first volley of shots at the crowd. It was unfortunate that Sarah\nPalin had used hunting terms in her campaign against health care and now lying about\nit made it all the more cowardly. It also fueled the collective anger of the tragedy.\nAll of the darkest and most profane activities began to manifest in the case and\ndemonstrated the worst in people even though there were commentators trying to\nsmooth things over using terms like heroism and how the American spirit pulls people\ntogether in times of crisis.\nThe political maneuvers of the Pima County Sherriff Clarence Dupnik began to further\npolarize America in what seemed like a scheme to spark political cold war and civil\nsocial war. Dupnik blamed talk radio for the actions of the shooter, that it was a\ncollective hate effort on the part of the political right wing. He placed the blame on the\npublic dialogue and the venom that spews from both the left wing and right wing.\nHe literally was illustrating the point that thoughts can kill and words make thoughts\nactive and later they can manifest into a monster that can easily get out of control and\nharm people. This outraged the right wing pundits who said that using \u201cpolitics\u201d during\na tragedy is morbid and macabre. I was watching this and wondering how suggesting\nsuch vitriol can have a negative impact on people was political? I also was thinking\nagain about the September 11th attacks were used for political maneuvers and how they\nwere exploited. The Sherriff was literally claiming that the mental state of our country is\nin such a crisis that Loughner is just a product of our times.\nHe was projecting and confirming that Loughner is the monster that a polarized and\nradical America had created like a homunculus or a Golem.\nHis biggest mistake however was singling out the political right in his statements and\nnot equally including the radicalized left wing and their thoughts on who should be\neliminated.\nIt was later that the killer\u2019s face was seen in news papers and on websites. Prior to his\nbeing sent to jail, his image was seen as a normal young man with short hair. There\nwere other images of him wearing a stocking cap with glasses. That was no longer the\ncase.\nLoughner was now being displayed with a shaved head, bald, with no eyebrows\ngrinning at the camera.\nHe was the shadow archetype of the \u201cgrinning death\u201d that many of my listeners claimed\nto be dreaming about. The others who dreamed of a bald \u201cslender man\u201d also could see\nthat the monster of our dreams and the egregore we feared had been captured and put\non display like a zoo animal.\nThe blood ran cold when I looked into the eyes of a monster that was fully manifested\nby the collective hate and negative thought forms of millions of people. He was the face\nof the Orwellian two minutes of hate, a product of our continued apocalyptic and fear\ndriven anger.\nThe hate did not stop, nor did the rhetoric. I was amazed at the huge uproar over\nthis shooting. The Westboro Baptist church, another hate group decided it was\ntime to protest the funerals. The church led by Fred Phelps has been a thorn in the\nside of Christianity and is a radical cult that has been known to hold up signs at\nfunerals thanking God that he has killed another sinner, or another participant in the\ngreat \u201cfaggot\u201d America.\nThis was another example of how the thoughts of hate were only magnifying an already\nugly moment in our history. The crescendo of all of the mess and chaos was given by\nsomeone who should have known better than to step in and try to make things better\nafter she had done so much harm.\nSarah Palin had made a video expressing her feelings on the matter. However it\nseemed that she was like a dumb fish taking the bait on the hook from an already\nangered left wing. Her statements were hollow and loaded with narcissism.\nShe was intimating that she too was a victim in the entire mess and was attacked\nunfairly by the left. The bodies of the dead in Arizona weren\u2019t even in the ground and\nPalin had come off sounding like she was wounded too. She was angry and claimed\nthat she was a victim of what she called \u201cBlood Libel.\u201d\nHer phrasing was very interesting because \u201cBlood Libel\u201d was used out of context. It\nis a most interesting use of the term when you consider its origins. Blood libel was an\nold accusation that Jews would sacrifice children and use their blood for the making of\nMatzos for Passover. This resulted in the murder of thousands of Jews. Many jews\nwere driven out because of the accusations.\nThe question is why is it that the term that hasn\u2019t been used for 900 years turns up\nagain? Keep in mind that its association with child sacrifice should be taken into\nconsideration as also another association that has not been cited in the mainstream.\nBlood Libel is also associated with \u201cThe Golem.\u201d In Jewish folklore the Golem is\na being that is conjured from inanimate matter and is activated by thought and\nincantations. The Golem was literally a monster made of clay programmed to defend\nand kill anyone who wished to harm a Jew. The most famous golem narrative involves\nJudah Loew ben Bezalel, the late 16th century chief rabbi of Prague, also known as the\nMaharal, who reportedly created a golem to defend the Prague ghetto from anti-Semitic\nattacks and pogroms sparked by Blood Libel accusations.\nGolems are monsters that are created for protection. Golems are not intelligent, and\nif commanded to perform a task, they will perform the instructions literally. In many\ndepictions golems are inherently perfectly obedient. In its earliest known modern\nform, one story has Rabbi Eliyahu of Che\u0142m creating a golem that became enormous\nand uncooperative. In one version of this story, the rabbi had to resort to trickery to\ndeactivate it, whereupon it crumbled upon its creator and crushed him.\nThis is similar to the Frankenstein story where the creator of the monster did so with\ngood intentions but his hubris got the best of him and his creation turned on him. The\nword Frankenstein itself means man of stone.\nThe golem has also evolved into the mindless zombie that becomes animated with\nsome kind of chemical or even by magical invocations that are found in rituals of\nvoodoo.\nThere was also Old Testament legends of Teraphim or severed shrunken heads that\nwere used as oracles. Magic words or thought forms were placed in the heads and they\nwere used in necromantic rituals.\nThese servitors or egregores were later spoken of by magicians like Aleister Crowley\nas powerful entities that can be created by thought. He spoke of something called a\nHomunculus or small silver man that would do his bidding and move at his every whim.\nThe egregore is different to the Golem, only in the fact that a collective is responsible for\nits creation not an individual. An egregore is quite literally an autonomous entity created\neither intentionally or unintentionally by a group thought form animated through magic.\nPolitical speeches like the one Palin delivered went to great lengths at trying to debunk\nthe idea that Jared Loughner was not a product of collective thought forms but a sick\nand mentally ill individual that should be blamed for his actions alone.\nThat doesn\u2019t excuse or even dismiss the fact that a hostile \u201cgroup think\u201d has developed\nin America and that if we are to believe that magicians of dark arts we are going to\nsee more of these monsters being created for the purpose of demonstrating that our\nhostilities, bigotry and xenophobia have generated a collective egregore.\nMany people will dismiss and even divorce themselves of any responsibility with regard\nto feeding and raising a monster in society. We have not found a genetic sequence or\ncode that shows that people are destined to become killers and assassins.\nMany are programmed to act as servitors for the so called \u201cgreater good\u201d and sacrifice\ntheir lives for ideas, thought forms and beliefs.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if the egregore is created by the power of the Holy Ghost or for the\nsake of Uncle Sam, it always seems to move and obey with the dictates, thoughts and\ndesires of the collective.\nWords are resonating now and they are triggering egregores that wish to do battle with\na system that is sick and corrupt. Conflict and crisis breeds these archetypes. They can\nbe invisible for the most part, but they can also manifest anywhere. Phrases like \u201cBlood\nLibel\u201d dig up 900 year old demons and they can move about in sick and twisted ways.\nIn the meantime the meme of the grinning bald man with no eyebrows sees you in your\ndreams and stares at you from the morning paper.\nHe is a reminder of how pressures can rise and burst into acts of violence. How little acts of violence can conjure all sorts of darker thoughts and words. How darker thoughts and words can spark wars. How wars can kill millions. How apologists will tell you that the deaths in war are sacrifices for the greater good.\nHow the end of the world happened with good intentions.\nBillconnerty\nWow. Very interesting comment. I remember reading something about egregores becoming semi materialized and energized not only from human thoughts but from external energy sources such as the planets and the Sun. During certain times such as Solar flares, gamma rays and other resonating sources magnetizing these elementals and they acquire additional powers and can sometimes become materialized. Examples such as the Loc Ness monster or bigfoot can be seen by individuals during these times. Even though they may have been real creatures thouaands of years ago they maintain their presence through our collective thought creatiuon.\nDtroyder\nI can agree with your thoughts.

Long/longish hair or shaved head, as either set\u00a0a beard off.\u00a0Shaved head and full beard is definitely a great look. I also would choose glasses over contacts. One question why do you want to start triming? You clearly have the goods to go longer.\nAlthough I don't mind the contact lens, I can't believe I'm going for glasses again. One of the cool things about contact lens is that one can choose to change up their look a bit.\nAlthough part of me would consider going longer, big beards has never been my thing for personal reasons. Let's just say I'm glad today that I can look at myself in the mirror and see my own reflection instead of someone else's.

I'm unsure if it's because I'm ugly or just because I'm fat but I'm sure it's a combination of both. I'm 6 foot 7 inches tall and I've always been told that girls like tall guys. Not tall ugly fat guys I guess. It doesn't help that I have crippling social anxiety and cant even start a conversation with a girl let alone carry on with a decent topic. This will eventually lead to my suicide. I'll die ugly and alone, the way it's always been for me.\nBe brutally honest please. The last thing I need is someone to lie to me and tell me I'm not ugly. I know I'm ugly, but how ugly do you think I am?\n(shitty iphone pics) http://i.imgur.com/EV9LwBZ.jpg\n2 years ago\nFucking hell. There's people here telling you you look really good. You came here for honesty, so I'm going to give you honesty.\nFirst off, I was in the exact same position you were in a few years ago. First thing I'll say: shut the fuck up and calm down. I am willing to bet from the way you worded your post that you're not manically depressed, so I'm not going to pull punches -- I got through it, and so can you.\nFirst of all, yes you are fucking ugly. And don't let these people around here say you're not. You are, for all intents and purposes, well below average. HOWEVER, 90% of this is because of your own shitty choices, and not genetic. This is really really good. Most ugly people don't have this benefit.\nFirst of all, stop the god damn pity party. All it does is make you miserable, and that make you more unattractive than any physical deficiency. Read books on guided meditation... read \"Feeling Good\" by David Burns. Learn to start taking a more positive outlook on life. Girls aren't everything in life, and even short fat gremlins find love. Look at Honey Boo Boo's mom, god damn, even she found love and raised a loving family.\nNext- fix yourself up. You have some incredible genetic gifts. First of all, you're white, that gives you a leg up to women against most other races. Second, you're tall -- HUGE advantage. Third, your bone structure is hidden behind all that fat, but there's nothing disproportionate about your features. Shave that head of yours.. you're balding, hanging onto a little pube trail up there isn't fooling anyone. You have a good head shape to pull off a bald look.\nCan you grow a full beard? If so do it, if not shave or trim your current beard. It looks like chewbacca threw up on your face. GO TO THE GOD DAMN GYM. It won't take more than a few months to slim down and start building some muscle. Throw out your shitty wardrobe and buy some good clothes, and stylish frames that fit your face.\nIf you actually work on it, you have enough of a genetic foundation to not just be not ugly, but actually very attractive. You have a ton of genetic advantages, stop pissing it away and go fix your life up and enjoy the rest of it. And don't you dare talk about suicide again.\n2 years ago\n2 years ago\nIf your local gym has a power rack and a bench, that's everything you need for Stronglifts . Three days a week, lots of progress, a focus on form.\nThe author recommends that women only increase weight by 2.5lbs on the bench and the overhead press, and advises that the empty barbell may be too heavy to start out with depending on your level of fitness.\nFor the first 5 to 6 weeks, the workouts will take a half hour total, on average, so the time commitment while you're getting used to it isn't terrible.\nThere's a (free) mobile app that does most of the bookkeeping for you. I highly recommend it.\n2 years ago\n2 years ago\n2 years ago\n2 years ago\nGood start! I would recommend shaving the beard down more around your lips, and rock a full goatee. The gym is tough the first time out, but honestly once you get there, you'll forget all about it and you'll begin to enjoy it! Try to pick a gym in the \"better\" part of town, near businesses and working-class people, so you don't have a lot of douchebgas.\nI'm very proud of you though, great job on taking the first step. Please keep me updated, and at any point the anxiety gets too bad, don't hesitate to message me. I've been where you are, and it's a difficult battle, but I know you can do it and it'll be so worth it.\n2 years ago\n2 years ago\nAbrasive or not, this is all EXACTLY what you need to hear and do, OP. Ignore everything else (except the /r/seduction suggestion- you could probably pick up a few things socially from there) in this thread until you follow all of this above advice.\nYou wanted brutal honesty and this is it. It might be the hardest thing of all for you to accept- you don't HAVE to be fat and ugly. You CAN be really attractive. Not everyone has that luxury. Now the responsibility is on you to get there.\n2 years ago\nSource: I have a round face.\n2 years ago\nTHIS RIGHT HERE, OP, IS THE CORRECT REPLY. Dude. The only thing stopping you from being attractive is yourself.\n6'7\", Blue eyes, ears don't stick out, nose isn't abnormally small/large, nice eyebrows (no unibrow is a plus). All you have to do is get in shape and build a wardrobe and you're good to fucking go.\n2 years ago\n2 years ago\n2 years ago\nI own that book, and it's actually really good.  It's not just reading the book that helps--it's using the emotional toolkit that the book teaches you that helps.\nIt's based around cognitive behavior therapy. So it teaches you to be more conscious of your thought patterns so you can catch yourself and talk yourself down when your thoughts are distorted.\nScientifically, the purpose is to form new neural pathways.  Our fight-or-flight response kicks in when we see a stick that looks like a snake, so our body responds before our higher brain says, \"fuck, that's just a stick.\" It's useful because it might actually be a snake one of these days.\nHaving a life-or-death response about starting a simple conversation is not appropriate or useful.  You absolutely can replace that response with a thought-process that makes it less scary.\nIt's not magic, but it can help a lot if OP puts the effort in.  He may need meds, but I think it's too early to say.\n2 years ago\n2 years ago\n2 years ago\nYou seem to feel sorry for yourself..that is a dangerous sentiment. Even if you were the most handsome man in the land, no woman is attracted to a dude who feels sorry for himself.\nI'm gonna be honest and say you're not ugly..but man, you need to take care of yourself. You are overweight, you don't give a shit about what you wear..\nStart giving a shit about yourself, and give less of a shit whether a girl looks at you.\nStop eating crappy food. Start exercising, for the love of Pete. You are in the prime of your life and you don't do anything for yourself, exercise-wise.\nStart observing dudes who seem 'less anxious' for what they choose, attire-wise.\nYour glasses: No offense to you or anyone else who wears them, but they don't exactly shout out \"Ladies Man.\" At least get glasses with frames.\n2 years ago\nTry /r/keto to lose that fat. It works quite fast.\n2 years ago\n2 years ago\n2 years ago\nShort term fixes:\n1) Grow your hair. Bald is a hard look to pull off. It doesn't work on you.\n2) Ditch those glasses and buy some cooler (thicker?) frames. Or do contacts if possible.\n3) Fashion: plain T-shirts and basketball shorts give off the impression that you don't give a shit. They look sloppy & gross. I know you're a big guy but there are better options. Heck, buy a pair of fitted pants or jeans at Costco and a nice button-down shirt. Think, \"classy.\"\nLong term fixes:\n1) The weight. This one is obvious, and I'm sure you know it needs to happen soon. If you don't start tackling this now, it will only get worse/harder. Visit /loseit and dedicate yourself to getting healthier.\n2) Confidence. I think this will improve big time once you become healthier because the physical change will make such a difference. But besides the physical aspect, what is special about you? It may take a while to learn the answer to this but I do believe it is possible.\nGood luck!\n2 years ago\n2 years ago\nEdit: Added link to /r/malefashionadvice\n2 years ago\n2 years ago\n2 years ago\n2 years ago\nThere are a few things that you can improve.\nAppearance\nphysique: I can't tell if you are overweight (looks like you have man-boobs but no big guts). If you are active, good and keep it up. You don't need to look like a chiseled statue but have a toned body is generally a good thing for both your health and confidence.\nFacial hair/Glasses: Decide a style. Manage your facial hair (and hair). Don't allow it to grow nillywilly - it's going to look unkept and very few people can pull it off. Spend time to manage it. Also the glasses does not suit you. Find something that compliments your face (shape) better. Talk to female acquaintance, store clerk, ask for recommendation here, etc.\nFashion/Clothing: At 6'7\" this is more of a problem for you. Clothes that fit will be more visually fit than those that don't (in general). I don't have enough knowledge on this issue but I'm sure there's some online forum that can help you. Perhaps check with /r/malefashionadvice . Or go to a mall and ask people that work in a clothing store.\nInsecurity: Confidence is sexy. Self-pity is not. With that being said it's harder to climb up than to stay up. You have to change your mentality first. And no one else can do it for you. You have to believe what you can achieve and WORK for it. Nothing that has meaning is supposed to be easy (or everyone can do it). Do you think if the A list celebrities sit on the couch and eat and not work out for a few months they'll still look attractive? Very very unlikely.\nGood luck.\n2 years ago\n2 years ago\n2 years ago\n2 years ago\n2 years ago\n2 years ago\n2 years ago\n2 years ago\n2 years ago\n2 years ago\n2 years ago\n2 years ago\n2 years ago\n2 years ago\n2 years ago\n/u/apollo_ape gave you some really good advice. I'd like to just add on to it a bit. You're glasses aren't working for you. Can you get contacts? If not, try a more modern frame. Like black, slightly thick frames that are rectangle. How do you normally dress? If you dress like you do in your pictures, then that's something you need to work on. Unless you're about to work out, save that look for the gym. Girls like guys who look like they put effort in the way they look. Which means, nice fitting jeans and nice shirts. If you have no idea where to start check out /r/malefashionadvice and it's also a good idea to have someone in mind as inspiration as to how you want to dress. If it's a celebrity then you can look up pictures of him and take note of his outfits and try to recreate.\nYou're not going to die ugly and alone if you take the advice that you've been given. Looking good takes a lot of effort, if you put in a lot of effort then you can reach your potential. If you don't put in any effort, then you're just going to stay the same and how will you ever know how attractive you can be?\n2 years ago\n2 years ago\n2 years ago\n2 years ago\n2 years ago\n2 years ago\n2 years ago\n2 years ago\nREDDIT and the ALIEN Logo are registered trademarks of reddit inc.\n",

Get noticed.\nHow to Look Attractive in Glasses\nHow to Look Attractive in Glasses\nToday\u2019s post is a guest piece written by Ruth Domber, owner of 10/10 Optics .\nYour eyewear just may be one of the most important accessories you wear. This one item can create the image that you\u2019d most like to project. Your specs say as much about you as the clothes on your back. With that in mind, here\u2019s how to choose frames that will make you look attractive. [Julie note: many women find glasses super sexy on a man, so it pays to find frames that truly flatter you.]\nSize matters The best nonverbal tool you have for communication is your eyes. By choosing a frame with the proper proportions, you maximize eye contact and increase possibilities for communication. Here\u2019s how to figure out the right size: pinpoint the widest part of your face as a guide for width, contour the shape of your brows for height and the top of your cheekbone for depth.\nQuick tips for a great fit\n*If you have oily skin, stay away from shiny frames and opt for a matte finish instead.\n*Make sure that your bridge (nose area) is a perfect fit, as that\u2019s the one part of the frame that cannot be easily corrected if the fit is off.\n*The arms of the glasses should not squeeze or push in on the sides of your face.\n*How deep should the frames sit on your face? Never past the flare of your nostrils and never resting on your cheeks.\n*The arms should be enough length to anchor at your temples at least 1/3 way around the back of your ear.\nOther features If your hair is thin, or you\u2019re bald, a bolder look brings the attention back to your eyes. Angles make weak jawline look more defined.\nColor as your best asset If you want to keep it businesslike, stay with blues, garnets and greens. Think about your favorite tie colors, and go in that direction. Color communicates individuality, creativity and openness to new\nideas. You can keep it subtle or go big.\nIf you\u2019re more into neutrals, use your hair or eye color as a simple way to find your best tones. And if you\u2019re not sure about color, try natural materials. Horn, wood and leather are all tactile and elegant choices.\nLet your glasses be an outward representation of who you are on the inside. If you\u2019re still unsure of what works for you, try on a few styles, take some pictures and compare to figure out which suits you best.\nIf you\u2019re in the NYC-area and in need of new glasses or sunglasses, I highly recommend you check out 10/10 Optics . It\u2019s one of my favorite local style resources!\nCheers,\nJulie\nLike this article? Sign up for updates!

            "96": "19\nAs we approach the first anniversary of his death, the Beyond Borges series arrives at the Argentine essayist and existentialist author Ernesto Sabato.\nErnesto Sabato, the essayist and novelist known for bringing Existentialism to Argentina\nAs revered at the time of his passing as Jorge Luis Borges , Sabato is widely-known for his role in bringing about justice for the crimes committed by the nation\u2019s military leaders during Argentina\u2019s most infamous dictatorship.\nHaving received a great deal of critical acclaim for his novels \u2018El t\u00fanel\u2019 and \u2018Sobre h\u00e9roes y tombas\u2019 he was awarded the 1984 Miguel de Cervantes prize and is commonly regarded one of South America\u2019s most influential writers.\nScientific Beginnings\nBorn in 1911 in Riojas, a small town in Buenos Aires province, Sabato was the tenth of 11 sons born to Italian immigrant parents. Whilst studying physics and mathematics at the University of La Plata he joined a movement of student activists calling for university reform and independence. By 1933 he had set up a campaign group of communist ideals and, during the same year, was appointed general secretary of the Communist Youth Federation.\nRecognising Sabato\u2019s waning belief in Stalin\u2019s methods a year later, the Communist Party of Argentina ordered him to attend the International Lenin School (ILS) for two years. En-route to Moscow he travelled first to Belgium as a delegate of the party and onto Paris, where he is said to have drafted his first unpublished novel, \u2018La fuente muda\u2019.\nOn his return to Argentina he married Matilde Kusminsky Richter, a woman he\u2019d met at a Marxist lecture in Belgium three years earlier, and in 1938 gained his PhD in physics from the University of La Plata aged 27.\nSabato's signature (Photo: Courtesy of Wikipedia)\nNobel laureate Bernardo Houssay helped to secure Sabato a research fellowship at the prestigious Institut Curie in Paris, which placed him among surrealist writers in an environment that would only draw out his creativity.\n\u201cDuring that time of antagonisms, I buried myself with electrometers and graduated cylinders during the morning, and spent the nights in bars with the delirious surrealists. At the D\u00f4me and in the Deux Magots , inebriated with those heralds of chaos and excess, we used to spend many hours creating exquisite cadavers ,\u201d he said.\nIn 1939 he transferred to Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and returned to Argentina one year later, intent on leaving science behind. Disillusioned with what he called the dehumanising effects of science, Sabato turned to literature, where he found the unexplained aspects of the human personality relayed in German romanticism and existentialism.\nWhilst he became almost immediately active in Argentina\u2019s literary circles he continued juggling his writing and teaching careers until 1943, when he eventually made a more permanent transition to writing.\nEchoes of Existentialism\nSabato published essays on a variety of scientific and literary topics, but famously burned many of his manuscripts. A surviving trio of novels includes the existentialist classic \u2018El t\u00fanel\u2019 (1948), \u2018Sobre h\u00e9roes y tumbas\u2019 (1961), and the lesser known \u2018Abadd\u00f3n el exterminador\u2019 (1974).\u00a0Though the second is generally considered his best work, it is his first novel which will likely remain the most known outside Argentina.\nOriginally published in Sur magazine in 1948, it received a great deal of attention from Nobel prize laureates Alfred Camus and Thomas Mann and was almost immediately picked up for translation by French publishing house Gallimard .\u00a0The first English translation in 1950 was superseded by a 1988 translation and the release of \u2018The tunnel\u2019 as a Penguin Classic only two days before Sabato\u2019s death last year will likely secure its place for some time as the most-widely read of all his novels.\nThe opening lines from 'El T\u00fanel' displayed outside Casa Museo Ernesto Sabato (Photo: Kate Bowen)\nCovering little more than 100 pages, \u2018El t\u00fanel\u2019 takes us on a discomforting journey into the mind of a convicted killer \u2013 the painter Juan Pablo Castel. Imprisoned for the murder of his lover Maria Iribarne, the novel begins with his confession and continues by explaining the circumstances of his crime.\nNarrated entirely in the first person, the scene is set entirely within Castel\u2019s conscience. Never stepping for a moment outside of his self absorbed and over-analytical mind, we are carried down every dark hallway of his paranoid imagination, charting the growth of every obsessive thought.\nWhilst some praise Sabato\u2019s approach for accurately presenting the complexities of a crazed mind, others have criticised him for painting his protagonist with too broad a stroke. Nonetheless, the novel succeeds in raising questions about logical understanding and rationality \u2013 is our killer insane, or quite the opposite?\nThough the reader may never be intended to achieve empathy, he does achieve, in some terrifying way, an understanding of his subject. Throughout the novel he is asked to continually shift his stance until it rests somewhere between sympathy and abhorrence.\nSince the opening lines of the novel grab the readers attention so firmly, Sabato sets himself the challenge of continuing a novel where the outcome is already known and the element of intrigue is lacking. While this does demand a certain tolerance from the reader, Sabato steers clear of tedium with an energy and a darkness that could only have been maintained successfully in such a short novel.\nOpinion remains divided, however. Some argue that Sabato\u2019s stab at the existentialist genre amounts to nothing more than an un-engaging retrospective that fails to reveal much about the human condition. For others, it is a novel well deserving of its place among the likes of Camus\u2019 \u2018The stranger\u2019 , Franz Kafka\u2019s \u2018The trial\u2019 and George Orwell\u2019s \u2018Nineteen eighty-four\u2019 on a shelf of existentialist classics.\nMany crime novels have since offered slices of insight into their killer\u2019s minds but, at the time, Sabato\u2019s edgy existentialism followed a genuinely innovative European wave and represented the height of originality in Argentine writing.\nPolitical Poles\nThough Sabato may always be remembered as a tireless campaigner for justice and human rights he has also come under occasional fire for his changing political positions. Where the likes of Leopoldo Lugones and Leopoldo Marechal made themselves unpopular with their political views, Borges and Sabato managed to swing their political stances relatively easily and relatively unnoticed.\nJournalist Osvaldo Bayer , however, accused him of forming part of the \u201cArgentine hypocrisy\u201d in light of his actions and apparently contradictory statements made during the Argentine dictatorship of 1976- 1983.\nSabato was characterised by his thick framed glasses, bald head and moustache\nCritical of the government of Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n , Sabato originally appeared welcoming of the military dictatorship that began in 1976 and lasted until 1983. In the same year, both he and Borges attended a dinner held by the military leader Jorge Rafael Videla , after which Sabato was recorded as commenting that Videla was a \u201ccultured\u201d man. Several years later he explained to a German magazine that the majority of Argentines had welcomed the military power because they\u2019d been able to put an end to the leftist groups threatening the stability of the country.\nAt the end of the dictatorship, newly elected president Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn appointed Sabato to preside over the National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons ( CONADEP ) \u2013 a newly created commission tasked with investigating the fate of tens of thousands of Argentines who disappeared at the hands of the military.\nSabato presented his findings to Alfons\u00edn on the 20 September 1984. His 50,000 page report entitled \u2018Nunca m\u00e1s\u2019 was later used to prosecute nine members of the military establishment for crimes committed during the dictatorship years.\nDespite whatever he may have said before, it is the undeniably good work he performed as president of CONADEP that has stayed in the memory of Argentines and resulted in Sabato\u2019s non-literary legacy being shaped to appear as significant as his literary one.\nCheap Private Proxies\nweb design ploiesti\nweb design prahova\nfurtdsolinopv\nweb design ploiesti\nRafael Ferr\nnnie\nModus, rozpoznawanie, rozszerzona o us\u0142ugi realizowanego programu.\nOchudzanie.

            "97": "Albert Mannes, a lecturer in\u00a0operations\u00a0and information management at the famed Wharton School, shaved his head when he started to go bald. Now, he has done research showing it was a wise decision.\nThree studies contribute to the literature on dominance and nonverbal behavior (Ellyson & Dovidio, 1985) by examining how a man\u2019s choice to shave his head influences person perception. In Study 1, men with shaved heads were rated as more dominant than similar men with full heads of hair. In Study 2, men whose hair was digitally removed were perceived as more dominant, taller, and stronger than their authentic selves. Study 3 extends these results with nonphotographic stimuli and demonstrates how men experiencing natural hair loss may improve their interpersonal standing by shaving. Theories of signaling, norm violation, and stereotypes are examined as explanations for the effect. Practical implications for men\u2019s psychological, social, and economic outlooks are also discussed.\nThat\u2019s all of the article itself that\u2019s available without purchase or subscription to an academic database. NBC recently reported on the article, however.\nSometime in his late 30s, after his hair had been thinning for several years, Dr. Albert Mannes decided to shave what was left of his mane. He then noticed a curious thing: \u201cStrangers were more standoffish, more deferential,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI found that people treated me differently once I started shaving my head, which made me wonder whether my experience was unique,\u201d says Mannes.\nThis led Mannes, a lecturer at the Wharton School, at the University of Pennsylvania, to design three experiments that tested other people\u2019s perception of men with shaved heads. His findings appear in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science.\u00a0All three studies found similar results: A man\u2019s shorn scalp was linked with dominance. In other words, men with shaved heads were perceived as powerful by others.\u00a0It seems that closely cropped or bald domes have a certain manly swagger to them that project a powerful look.\nIn the first study, 59 college students looked at 25 photographs of men enrolled in a business school program. Ten of the men had shaved heads while the rest wore their hair in various styles and lengths.\u00a0Volunteers rated the photos of men with shorn scalps as more dominant, meaning they looked more powerful, influential, and authoritative than those with a full head of hair.\n[\u2026]\nIn a third experiment, no photographs were used and more than 500 adults rated their perception of a man based solely on a written physical description of him. All volunteers read the exact same profile except for the description of his hair, which portrayed him as having thick brown hair, thinning brown hair, or a shaved head.\u00a0The man described as having a shaved head was rated highest in dominance, masculinity, leadership potential, and strength. The guy with thick tresses scored higher for attractiveness than a shorn scalp and slightly higher on confidence.\u00a0The dude with thinning hair scored the lowest on every trait except for norm violation.\n\u201cMen with thinning hair may improve their self-esteem and how they are perceived by others by shaving,\u201d Mannes suggests.\u00a0He advises men who are getting sparse on top \u201cto stop fighting Mother Nature and try the shaved look.\u201d\nIt\u2019s amusing that a Management PhD teaching in a business school has undertaken research in the field of psychology in order to confirm his own decision to shave his balding dome. \u00a0But, hey, it\u2019s science.\nAs for the results, there\u2019s presumably something to it. The shaved look has been in vogue now for two decades. It seems to have been popularized by black athletes, notably Michael Jordan, and more recently caught on with white men.\nThe Walter White character played by Bryan Cranston in \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d immediately came to mind when I saw the report; apparently, the same was true for the NBC photo editor. He\u2019s depicted at the top of the post. Below are two other recent photos of Cranston with hair:\nIn the first of these, obviously taken at the Golden Globes, Cranston clearly looks younger and friendlier than in the shaved head/goatee pic. In the second, though, he looks weaker. \u00a0That\u2019s presumably by design, since it\u2019s early in the series before White has made his transformation into a serious villain.

            "100": "\u00a0\nIt's a fun and raunchy musical, and, like in the movie, our costumes were rather fun and raunchy as well. I spent the entire show strutting around in a black bra top, a black g-string, black fishnet stockings and black character shoes with 2 1/2 inch heels. This costume is the reason that I, to this day, know how to swirl tassels - not easy. It's all about the timing. Don't ask.\nDuring the production, I made friends with a couple who were in the show together, an actor named Mitch Pileggi, and his then-wife, Debbie. You sci-fi folks would know Mitch as Skinner on The X-Files and as Colonel Caldwell on Stargate: Atlantis. Mitch is a wonderful, terribly charming guy (and a major flirt) and the sexiest bald man I've ever known.\nAnyway, Mitch and Debbie decided that they wanted to set me up on a date with a friend of theirs, a guy named Gary. At the time, I was only 19 (I'm guessing Mitch was in his late 20's) and I was very excited to be set up with this Gary guy, as he was a MUCH older man of...30. And he was a singer, who had actually CUT AN ALBUM. Very exciting.\nSo I agreed to meet this guy, and Mitch set it up that Gary would come and watch the show and then we'd all go out afterward.\n\u00a0\nAll of my fellow chorus girls and I were still wearing out bra/g-string outfits, but for this number, we added tall feathered headdresses and huge white feathered fans a la Busby Berkeley.\nAt some point during the song, we ran around backstage, climbed a flight of stairs, entered the courtroom set from above and proceeded to dance our way down a long, glittery stairway, smiling and step-kicking like the Rockettes.\nStep, kick, step, kick, smile, wave the fan, step, kick, step, kick, Razzle Dazzle 'em...\nThen, on the 5th from the bottom step...the heel of my character shoe caught on the decorative Mylar strip around the edge of the stairs and I...\nFell.\nOn my face.\nThe audience gasped.\nThe feather fan flew across the stage.\nI took a deep breath and stood up, located my feather fan and...\nDANCED.\nI just kept on smiling and dancing and singing while I turned about 15 shades of scarlet, and blood ran down my leg.\nAfter the show, I rushed to the dressing room and hid in mortification. Mitch had to literally drag me out of the dressing room to meet Gary, who was very kind, and I actually ended up going out with a couple of times.\nAnd to make me feel better, Gary did share an excellent story with me, of HIS most embarrassing moment, which is worth sharing with you. He and Mitch had met doing a production of Jesus Christ Superstar - Gary had been Jesus and Mitch was Pontius Pilate. One night, during the crucifixion scene, after the Roman soldiers had nailed him to the cross, the entire cross fell over...into the audience. The apostles and the Roman soldiers and the Virgin Mary were all trying to drag Jesus out of the audience and put him back on the cross, but then they all started to giggle...an ugly scene. But it did make me feel better.\n__________________________________\nAfter you've managed to wipe the image of my humiliation out of your mind, please drop by all of our other BRAVE spinners who have shared their most embarrassing moments with us all. And boy, are there some doozies.\nAt the Movies\nIt's Oscar time once again! So I thought that in preparation for Hollywood's big night, we could all talk about the Silver Screen - motion pictures, the cinema, flicks. Do you love comedies? Dramas that make you cry like a baby? Are you a horror fan? Sci-fi? Do you have a favorite movie of all time, one you could watch over and over? Or a movie that you can't stand, but everybody else seems to love? Is there a movie that changed your life?

Hands down.\nWe are now officially crazy for fondue! It was so stinking good! We all made absolute pigs of ourselves, even Jude McPicky. And it was FUN, all of us circled around the flaming Sterno pot, dipping and slurping. Decadent. And SO stinking EASY.\nFirst Course - Shrimp in Tomato Sauce\nNot fondue. But this was Jude's request, and I just couldn't refuse him. He has only recently decided that he likes shrimp. Now, you have to understand how big this is for our family. Jimmy and I are serious seafood eaters, and Jude's refusal to even try things was a big, fat pain in the butt. But he has now decided that he likes shrimp, but only if it is cooked in a tomato sauce. So...\nShrimp in Tomato Sauce\n1 big clove garlic, minced\na couple of tablespoons of olive oil\n1 lb raw shrimp, peeled and deveined\nPut tomatoes and their juice in a blender and puree.\nHeat oil in a large saucepan, add the garlic and saute for about 30 seconds. Add tomato puree and about a half a can of water.\nBring to a simmer and cook for about 20 minutes. Add shrimp and simmer for about 5 minutes, until shrimp are just cooked through.\nYou can then serve this over linguini or spaghetti. But for some reason Jude decided he wanted the shrinp served on a plate as an appetizer - I think he just likes when he gets to use the little cocktail forks. Anyway, I saved the sauce to go over pasta the next day.\nJude ate about 20 shrimp! Jimmy is worried that we've created a monster, and now there's going to be fewer shrimp for him!\nSecond Course - Cheese Fondue\nI really didn't think that Jude was going to eat this, as there's a fairly sophisticated flavor profile to this cheese - not your usual kid-friendly American or Cheddar. But he LOVED it (though he only dipped the bread and crab - nary a vegetable). Plus, it's a big, stringy, cheese adventure in eating, so what's not to love.\nI fear that this is so good, that we MUST get the leftovers out of the house, because neither Jimmy or I have been able to keep our heads out of the fridge. It's totally addicting. This is very bad.\nClassic Cheese Fondue\nI found this exact recipe in three different places around the internet. And Jan's recipe is basically the same thing, just tweaked to fit her \"real food\" diet. So I'm guessing it's pretty classic.\n1 clove garlic, minced\n1 lb. Gruyere cheese\n1 3/4 cup dry white wine\n1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg\nA splash or two of kirsch (optional - I didn't have any, so did without)\nToss the cheese with the flour. Place a saucepan  over medium heat and add the wine and garlic. Bring to a simmer and add  the cheese, one handful at a time stirring until the cheese is melted in before adding the next handful. Stir in the nutmeg.\nStir over low heat until smooth and cheese is  melted and bubbling. Add the kirsch, if using, and continue stirring  just until it begins to bubble. Transfer the cheese mixture to a heated  fondue pot when ready for dipping. Stir frequently.\nI served it with blanched cauliflower, cubed crusty bread, roasted brussels sprouts, roasted fingerling potatoes and chunks of crab leg.\nBut you can basically use any blanched or roasted vegetable you want that you think goes with cheese. Jan even used apple slices, which I kind of wish I had done, as Jude would have probably eaten them.\nWeird, artsy (out of focus) shots of fondue\nDessert - Chocolate Fondue\nIn all seriousness, I have never witnessed anything as depraved and animalistic as Jimmy and Jude falling upon this big pot of hot, melted chocolate. They were like Augustus Gloop and the river of chocolate in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. They were like vampires swooping down on a fresh kill. It was stunning and a little frightening. They both ended up with chocolate dripping down their chins and forearms!\nChocolate Fondue\n1 1/2 cups heavy cream\nIn a medium saucepan over low heat bring the cream to a simmer. Add the  chocolate. Simmer, stirring until the chocolate is melted. Transfer the  mixture to a fondue pot.\nI served it with little brownie squares, chocolate chip cookies, strawberries and a cut up glazed donut. But you could use pretty much any kind of fresh or dried fruit, as well as cubes of angel food cake, pound cake, graham crackers, lady fingers, marshmallows or biscotti.\nI'm seriously thinking of doing more fondue for the Academy Awards. Maybe this time I'll try the broth fondue version - you heat broth in the pot and everybody skewers little chunks of steak, chicken or shrimp and cooks it themselves in the broth, and you serve it with a variety of dipping sauces. Although, it seems like this might require a bit of patience, and neither Jimmy nor Jude have any. We'll see.\nAfter we all ate ourselves silly and Jimmy and I drank a bottle of champagne, we all snuggled into the bed together again. The men and the dog were snoring within minutes, and I got to plug my earplugs into my laptop and watch a little Netflix in bed.

I'll let you know how it goes.\n\u00a0\n_________________________________\nSo go drop in on Stacy for more randomness.\nThis is what I'd call the definition of \"a big drag, man\".\nTwo years ago, I wrote this post , telling y'all that Becky the Suburban Matron had been diagnosed with breast cancer, and I asked you all to start praying in an attempt to surround her with a \"big, bloggy bubble of love\".\n\u00a0\nBecky survived...no, TRIUMPHED over all this with tremendous grace and humor, proving herself to be the Jane Austen of the blogging world. Hell, in the middle of it she even finished up her PhD! So that makes her Dr. Becky. Oh yeah.\nWell now this.\nBecky's beautiful, darling, funny, brilliant sister Amy, the Matron Down Under , has been diagnosed with...breast cancer.\nI know, I know, I know.\nFor those of you who don't know/read Amy, you should, but if you don't, Amy and her husband, Jason, are ministers who are pastors at a church in Sydney, Australia. They have 3 of the cutest children you've ever seen.\nAmy is every bit as gracious and funny as Becky. I guess that makes her Jane Austen's sister. Wait, did Jane Austen have a sister?...Wikipedia...Yes, Cassandra Austen. No wait, Cassandra never wrote anything. So I guess they're more like the Brontes. But I don't really think of the Brontes as witty. More like the Mitford sisters Yeah. The Mitford Sisters works. Sorry...I just went off on a wee tangent. Sigh...here I am trying to be funny when we're talking cancer.\nAnyway, Amy IS funny, evidenced by her posts revealing her new-found cancer - here and here . She's one of the few bloggers I read who always makes me laugh with her self-deprecating charm and wit. She is also a woman of tremendous faith and courage.\nAnd her prognosis looks great. They have found the tumor VERY early, through what Becky described as a \"for-the-heck-of-it\" ultrasound.\u00a0 Because of the early diagnosis Amy will only need to have a lumpectomy, followed by radiation treatment. She won't know until after the surgery if she will need chemotherapy - there's a good chance she won't. Though if she does, I'm sure Becky will be happy to lend her Codi.\nI am completely sickened by the injustice of this all. How is it that while the national statistics are that 1 in 8 women will get breast cancer, in their amazing family it's 2 in 2. It's just so unfair.\nBut really, if there's a family who can survive and triumph over such a mess, it's these guys. I've never known a family filled with more love and humor and intelligence. The whole bunch of them are amazing. I have previously mentioned my desire to be adopted by their parents, but I don't think they think I'm serious. But I am. I would very much like to be their big sister.\nDon't you LOVE that picture? It's Becky and Amy and their brother Dave back when they were kids. It's kind of perfect, isn't it? I like to think that I'm the one in that boat in the background, their older sister who is supposed to be babysitting but instead, is drinking beer and \"fishing\" with her boyfriend. But I'm digressing once again...\nSo here's what we're gonna do. We're all going to start praying for Amy and her family. Just like we did for Becky. If we all start praying (or sending healing energy or white light or whatever) in her direction, we will create another big bloggy bubble of love and support to help her kick the cancer out of her body and tell it never to come back. Only this time the bubble is going to have to reach all the way to Australia, so PRAY HARD.\u00a0 I firmly believe in the power of prayer, and I know that Amy does as well. So DO IT!\nStart...NOW.\nOh, and if Amy's parents happen to read this, now would be an excellent time for this adoption, as you could probably use a little help. And there were three Bronte sisters. I'm a good cook, and willing to take care of you in your golden years. And I come cheap, you didn't have to pay for my college or my wedding. A good deal, I think. Consider it.\nAre y'all praying? Well DO it.\nOh, and FEEL YOUR BOOBIES. Here's a post I wrote a while back with detailed instructions .\nWe love you Amy.\nAre you ready for some blushing? Some humiliation, mortification, abasement and indignity?\nWell you've come to the right place! This week's Spin Cycle is all about our...\nMost Embarrassing Moment.\nHehehehehe. I've had that evil giggle ever since I assigned this.\nBut fear not, sharing is caring. You're not alone. And I promise to share MY most embarrassing moment with you all. And it's pretty damned embarrassing. I mean, it's not Dan-Quayle-misspelling-potato embarrassing, but it's pretty bad. I would say it's more along the lines of Janet-Jackson-wardrobe-malfunction embarrassing.\nSo how bad could yours be?\nOh, that bad? Oh my, oh my, oh my...\nSo here comes the shame, disgrace, discomfiture and degradation...\nHehehehehe.\n<center><a href=\"http://www.secondblooming.typepad.com/\" _mce_href=\"http://www.secondblooming.typepad.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://secondblooming.typepad.com/spincyclekeelyresize.jpg /\" _mce_src=\"http://secondblooming.typepad.com/spincyclekeelyresize.jpg /\" alt=\"Second Blooming\"></a></center>\nJimmy and I got married on September 30, 1995. While Jimmy's family gave us generous cash gifts, which helped tremendously, we basically paid for the whole shebang ourselves. Both of my parents had passed away, and we were...old. Well, sort of old - I was 35 and he was...gasp...40. So according to Emily Post, we were on our own. While we were in no way poor, we weren't loaded either, and didn't relish the idea of going into debt before we even started our life together.\nSo I put out a plea to all of our friends that if anyone wanted to offer as a wedding gift some kind of service in lieu of a place setting of china, we would be very happy.\nOur extremely creative friends rose to the occasion. Denise (who at the time was the Costume Designer for Melrose Place) designed and made my wedding gown, Patricia bought and arranged all the flowers, Donald was the DJ, Deasa decorated the church. And my friend Craig (the one whose dad was the voice of The Robot on Lost in Space) gave us all of his frequent flyer miles, so we could go on a honeymoon. The only stipulation was that we had to go somewhere Southwest Airlines flew.\nAfter months of working and planning for our wedding, the insanity of the week of the event and the craziness of our big and wacky wedding, we really needed some time to relax. Some place peaceful and slow-paced, where we could relax and regroup.\nSo of course we chose...New Orleans!\nThe best way I can describe our honeymoon is...4 nights of debauchery. Honest to God. We stayed drunk for 4 full days - no small feat. And ate like pigs. Dionysus would have been proud. Because anybody who has ever visited New Orleans knows that the town is slightly evil, and extremely seductive.\n\"Good morning, ma'am. Would you care for a Brandy Milk Punch with your breakfast?\"\n\"Oh, I really shouldn't...mmmm...Okay!\"\nOnly in New Orleans does it seem appropriate, no, downright necessary to work in some kind of elaborate cocktail with every meal. Check out the \"Eye Openers\" menu at Brennan's - 15 different breakfast cocktails available to go along with your eggs and crepes, from a Bloody Bull to an Absinthe Frappe.\nWe stayed at the historic Olivier House Hotel in the French Quarter, which was very lovely and romantic.\nAnd we did manage to do a bit of the usual touristy stuff. We visited Marie Laveau's House of Voodoo Museum , took a Mississippi Riverboat Cruise and got tarot card readings at the Bottom of the Cup Tearoom.\nAnd of course being...us...we took our very own Streetcar Named Desire tour of The Quarter.\nAnd of course...\nBut mostly, we just caroused.\nWe keep saying we want to go back. 10th Anniversary...didn't happen. 15th Anniversary...didn't happen. Let's cross our fingers for the 20th.\nOf course, by then we'll be so damned old that we won't be able to take all that partying, and it will no doubt be a much mellower trip.\nNAAAAAH!\n___________________________________\nPlease check out all of the other Spin Cycle honeymooners. Aren't they romantic...\nI'm feeling a little subversive this week.\nHmmm...What topic could I come up with that would really...mess...with everybody?\nI know...how about...\nMost Embarrassing Moment.\nYes, we all have them. That one time when we did something SO foolish, SO humiliating, that it has haunted us all of our lives.\nAnd now's your chance to share this with AAAAALLL the internet.\nHehehehe.\nSo you know the rules...write your incredibly humiliating and embarrassing post...let me know you did in a comment...copy and paste my extremely cool button into your HTML...come back here next Friday to see my spin...visit all the other spinners...find out what next week's spin will be.\nAnd if you can't remember that, just click on the Spin Cycle tab up there.\nI can't wait.

I have talked about him before. Here .\nJoe is a nice-looking, 50-something, Italian-American, never-been-married, consummate-playboy, Peter Pan syndrome-epitomizing, terribly-charming actor. Even though Jimmy's known him forever, and Jude considers him \"Uncle Joe\", he's the guy that I would NEVER set one of my girlfriends up with because the man is TROUBLE.\nAs I said in the post I linked above, which I'm sure none of you clicked on, over the many years, I have become something of a\u00a0 mother/confessor/sister to him. He comes to me with his endless woman  problems. He always flirts with me, but I'm pretty sure it's because he considers me \"safe\" and nonthreatening.\nJoe's \"women problems\" are epic and endless. He is a hopeless romantic, who falls in love hard, then always manages to manufacture some tragic reason why they could never stay together. His girlfriends are usually wonderful women, who I like immediately. But then he always finds...a problem. He often obsesses. Can we say \"restraining order\"?\nHe idealizes women, putting them on such a lofty pedestal that they have no possibility of doing anything but falling. I think he idealizes me. I seem to be the wife/mother figure that he knows he could never have.\nOver the years, he has moved back and forth between Los Angeles and New York many times. Presently, he lives in Manhattan. But when Jude was born, he was living in LA.\nThe Set Up:\nWhen I was pregnant with Jude I gained 60 pounds. Shocking, but true. So...keep that in mind.\nDISCLAIMER: Any man reading this, who wants to continue to idealize  women...please stop reading now. The truth is about to be spoken.\nI gave birth to Jude on May 6, 2003 at 6:38 a.m. at Cedars-Sinai Hospital. After birthing, we were taken to our hospital room.\nAnybody who has endured a vaginal birthing experience knows that after pushing out an 8 lb, 6 oz, 21 inch baby, a woman's hoo-hoo is a disaster. Dreadful things like \"ripping\" and \"stitches\" happen. Not a pretty picture. Keep that in mind too.\nI'm afraid I don't know if this is standard at every hospital, but at Cedars, after giving birth, they provide you with the following items:\nRubber surgical gloves filled with ice. One uses these as ice packs to reduce the hoo-hoo swelling. Every new mother is instructed to stick the icy glove between her legs and keep it there.\nA girdle-like sheer nylon mesh thing - like the top of a pair of pantyhose. The new mother is told to put it on and use it to hold the aforementioned glove of ice on their poor, swollen hoo-hoo.\nA hideously unattractive hospital gown, which opens in the back.\u00a0\nKeep all of that in mind.\nThe Event:\nOn the afternoon after Jude's birth, Jimmy left the hospital to go home  and feed the cat, and I was left alone in the hospital with baby  Jude.\nNow, when I say alone, I don't really mean alone, because  at Cedars, the nursing staff is so annoyingly diligent that they  NEVER leave you alone. About every 15 minutes they were knocking and  entering and questioning and checking and fiddling. Aggravating and  exhausting. They would not leave me alone.\nAt some point, Baby Jude, who was asleep in his tiny bassinet, woke up and started to fuss. I managed to drag myself out of the hospital bed and shuffled over to pick him up. When I reached him, there was yet another of the endless knocks at the door.\n\"Yes, what IS IT?!\" I cried out as I bent over to pick him up, my back to the door, and accidentally allowed my hospital gown to fall to the sides.\nYou've guessed where this is going, haven't you.\nThe door flew open and in walked...Joe.\nAnd there, right in front of his face, was my fat, naked ass, squished like a sausage into that see-through, diaper-like girdle, with a big ice-filled hand stuck between my legs.\nJoe shrieked like a little girl, dropped the gift he was carrying and fled down the hall.\nAs soon as he had managed to return his eyeballs back into their sockets and stop hyperventilating from the horror of his vision, he returned to the room. By then, I had managed to pick up the baby, crawl back into bed, and arrange myself into a Madonna and Child-like tableau, in an attempt to erase some of the trauma from his mind, and restore for him some of the vision of perfection he had previously expected of a new mother.\nWe never spoke of this. I was a tad embarrassed. And he was almost certainly deeply scarred.\n__________________________________\nPrompt #1: Who was at your front door?\nPlease visit Mama Kat for more inspired and inspiring posts!\nOh no.\nDo you remember back two years ago, when I spent two weeks on the sofa with stinking, fracking vertigo ? Well, I did. And now I fear that it's BACK.\nIt's not as bad as before - I don't actually feel like I'm on a boat. I just have a head full of cotton, a complete inability to think straight, and I'm about half deaf. I'm guessing it's the same inflammation of the inner ear thing as before. I really don't NEED this.\nI seem to be unable to concentrate, or come up with any ideas. But luckily, Mamarazzi has provided a bit of inspiration, so I'm diving into WWTK Wednesday once again...\n1. What is for dinner tonight (bonus for sharing the recipe)?\nWe have been crazy for veggies around here lately, because I've started getting organic produce DELIVERED to our home, which is a little bit of brilliance. I have a whole post planned about this, so the details will be forthcoming as soon as the cotton clears out of my brain. Anyway, we have been eating lots of excellent produce. And since the thought of grocery shopping makes me slightly queasy, this delivery thing is excellent. Tonight I'm pulling some chicken/apple sausage out of the freezer and serving it with Jan's Pan-Fried Fingerling Potatoes and some fresh spinach, which I'm just going to saute with a little olive oil and garlic. Now here's my question...do I still get the bonus if I'm only providing a link to the recipe? And what is this bonus anyway? Ooo, I hope it's money.\n2) Share something you are currently looking forward to.\nI am determined to get to Austin this summer! My old college gang is planning another reunion, and I am going to do everything I can to make it a nice long trip so I can see all my girlfriends and my cousins. PLEASE God makes this work! I need me a Texas fix!\n3) What are your thoughts on re-gifting?\nI would say that it depends entirely on the thoughtfulness behind the re-gifting. If someone gives you something and you're not sure if you'll ever actually use it, but when you look at it you think \"That's SO perfect for...\" whoever, then giving it to whoever is fine and dandy. If someone gives you something that you don't want and you give it away just to get rid of it and because you're too lazy to go and shop for somebody, then it's just plain tacky.\n4) How often do you rearrange your furniture?\nNever. I'm stuck in a rut.\u00a0\n5) Share a picture from your cellphone or camera.\nOh well now, isn't this handy! Jude and I spent a pleasant but mostly uneventful weekend at Cub Scout Winter Camp in Lake Arrowhead, and I was wondering how I was going to work in the pictures! I went a little crazy with the Hipstamatic...\nAnd a fun time was had by all.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWe're all taking a trip down Memory Lane this week on the Spin Cycle and sharing our honeymoons - that most romantic of all times...or not.\nAnd \"Bang, zoom...to the moon, Alice\" here we go...\n<center><a href=\"http://www.secondblooming.typepad.com/\" _mce_href=\"http://www.secondblooming.typepad.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://secondblooming.typepad.com/spincyclekeelyresize.jpg /\" _mce_src=\"http://secondblooming.typepad.com/spincyclekeelyresize.jpg /\" alt=\"Second Blooming\"></a></center>\n\u00a0\nI gather, from my Facebook news feed, that lots of people thought she was just terrific. So this might not be very popular,\u00a0 but I hated it. Just for full disclosure, I must admit that I haven't liked anything the woman's done since Desperately Seeking Susan, so you can take this all with a big grain of kosher salt. I do appreciate that she's a wonderful showman ( the production value was very high - all those gladiators and lyre-playing cupids were pretty impressive) and a savvy business woman (she was smart enough to invite all those other recording artists that the \"young folks\" like to join her, so she would appear to still have relevance in the musical world). But the whole performance just left me cold.\nAnd I'm about to say something that I really can't believe I'm gonna say. I am a fellow middle-aged woman, and I have never felt that age should make a woman stop acting like herself. I think that women of all ages can and SHOULD be sexy as hell. And Madonna still has an absolutely smokin' body.\nThat said...I think she's just gotten a little too old to do all that hootchy-cootchy dancing. I mean, the woman is 53 for God's sake. I kept thinking that she was gonna hurt herself. And she did, in fact, almost fall off the stage at about the 3:30 minute mark. No way she could have done those cartwheels without the spotters! And the 53-year old cheerleader thing was just silly. Jimmy kept asking \"Why does she have that stupid smile on her face?\", which he was right about, and all I could think was that all of us middle-aged women photograph a little better with a smile, and she was just working that.\nOkay, I'm sorry, I'm a bitch.\n___________________________________\nRemember a few weeks ago, when I posted this recipe for Jan's Make Ahead Monday - Turkey, Artichoke and Spinach Stuffed Shells ? Well, I had actually made it for Jimmy a few days before that, on Friday, January 13, to be exact. We ate most of it, but then Jimmy stuck the last leftover bit in a plastic dish, covered it with foil and stuck it in the fridge. The deal with the foil is an issue in our house, as Jimmy can never manage to locate the lid that fits the plastic containers - NOT REALLY THAT HARD. Anyway...\n________________________________\nThe other day at Jude's school, his class got to come to school dressed as their \"Dream Job\" (and yes, it sounds like a Spin Cycle topic). After a bit of consideration, Jude decided to go as...a lawyer. I'm afraid that only the child of two actors would consider being a lawyer to be a \"dream job\".\n__________________________________\nPlease explain to me why in a world in which Facebook knows to show me ads specifically geared to a \"50-year old actress in Los Angeles who has a child under 9, sings in a church choir and believes in gay marriage\", Amazon keeps sending me emails for things geared for TODDLERS? YES Amazon, I did in fact purchase a Thomas the Tank Engine DVD from you FIVE YEARS AGO. But that same child now has no interest in ...\nGet with it!!\n__________________________________\n__________________________________\n\u00a0\nShare your spin!\nHighlight the code.\nWhat Jude's reading...\n"

Aujourd\u2019hui, la tendance est plut\u00f4t au m\u00e2le mal ras\u00e9, voire \u00e0 la barbe de 3 jours (les moustaches fines redeviennent \u00e0 la mode). La barbe, la vraie barbe, la barbe \u00e0 papa revient aussi. (Vous n\u2019avez qu\u2019\u00e0 voir Charles Liebert qui est un magnifique exemple).\nBarbes et moustaches sont aujourd\u2019hui des accessoires de mode. L\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la barbe en effet, c\u2019est qu\u2019elle pousse (quelque chose comme 500 poils au cm2). Nous pouvons donc changer cet accessoire par un simple rasage ou nous pouvons la tailler. Quel accessoire simple et facile \u00e0 transformer.\nLa barbe de S\u00e9bastien Chabal a permis une grande avanc\u00e9e vers le retour \u00e0 cette pilosit\u00e9. M\u00eame les entreprises sont plus permissives \u00e0 ce niveau.\nAu moment o\u00f9 les femmes montrent de plus en plus leur f\u00e9minit\u00e9 acquise, les hommes reviennent \u00e0 la mode de la pilosit\u00e9. Un vrai delta entre masculin et f\u00e9minin, dans le genre \u00ab Moi Tarzan, toi Jane \u00bb.\nPour en revenir sur la barbe, nous avons entendu pleins de choses sur elle. Sale, sexy\u2026  sans devenir de gros b\u00fbcherons, quelle barbe porter ?\nHistoire de Barbe\nLe port de la barbe a souvent \u00e9t\u00e9 associ\u00e9 \u00e0 un statut social, \u00e0 un signe de maturit\u00e9, de sagesse\u2026 Les Grecs et les Romains, par opposition aux barbares adeptes des cheveux longs et de la longue barbe, se rasaient pour marquer leur c\u00f4t\u00e9 \u201ccivilis\u00e9\u201d. On le remarque d\u2019ailleurs en observant les bustes de l\u2019Antiquit\u00e9. Mais les philosophes antiques avaient pour habitude de porter une barbe. En Egypte, le port de la barbe \u00e9tait un attribut du pouvoir. Autrement dit, l\u2019histoire a codifi\u00e9 le port ou non de la barbe et fa\u00e7onn\u00e9 les modes.\nDes si\u00e8cles plus tard, ces attributs pileux reviennent en force chez des hommes qui en prennent grand soin : on les taille, les parfume et on leur fait prendre des formes particuli\u00e8res. Les accessoires pileux ont aussi habill\u00e9 les r\u00e9volutionnaires et autres contestaires de l\u2019ordre \u00e9tabli : Karl Marx et sa barbe touffue, Jean Jaur\u00e8s, le mouvement hippie bien plus tard\u2026\nMais les p\u00e9riodes de guerre mettent un frein aux pilosit\u00e9s en tout genre. Les \u201cpoilus\u201d et les soldats de la Seconde guerre mondiale optent pour des visages lisses \u00e0 l\u2019issue des conflits, comme pour exorciser des ann\u00e9es de laisser aller pileux.\nPour arriver de nos jours, les ann\u00e9es 90 sont marqu\u00e9es par les hommes imberbes, les m\u00e9trosexuels. Puis avec le d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es 2000 nous revenons \u00e0 une expression plus naturelle de la pilosit\u00e9. Les hommes se rasent moins et montrent leurs torses velus sans complexe. La barbe se d\u00e9tache de toute sa port\u00e9e symbolique.\nY a-t-il un \u00fcber-engouement pour la barbe ?\nLa tendance est aujourd\u2019hui \u00e0 la barbe de trois jours, faussement n\u00e9glig\u00e9e, et aux boucs finement taill\u00e9s entourant la bouche et le menton.\nMais il existe pour autant plusieurs sortes de barbes :\nLa barbe gainsbourienne : C\u2019est celle de David Duchovny dans la s\u00e9rie \u00abCalifornication\u00bb, de Hugh Laurie dans \u00abDocteur House\u00bb ou de Daniel Auteuil dans \u00abMR73\u00bb. C\u2019est le poil de ceux qui boivent et fument, vivent la nuit (on se rase le matin), n\u2019ont pas de femme attitr\u00e9e \u00e0 la maison (80% des rasoirs sont achet\u00e9s par des clientes) et affichent une certaine d\u00e9glingue. Irr\u00e9sistible pour les femmes qui se sentent une \u00e2me d\u2019infirmi\u00e8re. C\u2019est la barbe existentielle.\nLa barbe \u00e0 papa : C\u2019est celle des frais sexag\u00e9naires comme Fran\u00e7ois Berl\u00e9and ou Jacques Weber. Souvent blanche, elle dissimile les premiers signes d\u2019affaissement du visage et dotent son propri\u00e9taire d\u2019une certaine sagesse ou \u00e9l\u00e9gance. C\u2019est la barbe lifting.\nLa barbe qui m\u00fbrit : C\u2019est celle de Julien Dor\u00e9, le gagnant de la Nouvelle Star, ou de James Blunt, des poils plut\u00f4t lisses et parfois clarsem\u00e9s qui cachent des visages encore poupins. C\u2019est la barbe repousse-minette (h\u00e9las, elles adorent \u00e7a !)\nLa barbe dandy : C\u2019est celle d\u2019Edouard Baer, de Yann Barth\u00e8s, de Romain Duris, des \u00abadulescents\u00bb d\u00e9cal\u00e9s, lunaires, moqueurs, aux coiffures savamment d\u00e9coiff\u00e9es, qui ne veulent pas ressembler \u00e0 leurs p\u00e8res ras\u00e9s de pr\u00e8s signe d\u2019ali\u00e9nation. Message subliminal: Raser me rase.\nLa barbe \u00abj\u2019ai tellement mieux \u00e0 faire \u00bb : C\u2019est celle, poivre et sel, \u00e0 gros grain, de George Clooney qui l\u2019affiche depuis plusieurs semaines comme le comble d\u2019une virilit\u00e9 d\u00e9complex\u00e9e. Suffisamment courte pour laisser entrevoir les rides et fossettes, suffisamment longue pour dissimuler les petits d\u00e9fauts. C\u2019est l\u2019ornement du chef. Un signe de libert\u00e9.\nLa barbe du \u00abj\u2019aurais pas d\u00fb\u00bb : Celle de Pierre Moscovici, d\u00e9put\u00e9 socialiste fran\u00e7ais, qui, du coup, ressemble \u00e0 G\u00e9rard Jugnot version SDF.\nEntretien de Barbe\nLe look barbe de 3 jours est le plus facile \u00e0 entretenir. Le passage r\u00e9gulier d\u2019une tondeuse \u00e0 barbe maintiendra une longueur de poil raisonnable. A noter que certaines tondeuses \u00e0 cheveux ont d\u00e9sormais des sabots adapt\u00e9s aux poils de barbe. Lavez-vous le visage avec du savon doux sous la douche pour ne pas agresser votre visage. En effet, la barbe habille votre peau mais ne l\u2019a prot\u00e8ge pas des agressions cosm\u00e9tiques. Si vous souhaitez avoir une barbe bien d\u00e9finie, rasez au rasoir m\u00e9canique ou \u00e9lectrique les poils sur le cou, et suivez la forme du menton pour un r\u00e9sultat net.\nPour les barbes plus fournies, il faudra se doter d\u2019une paire de ciseaux \u00e0 barbe et d\u2019un peigne tr\u00e8s fin. L\u2019op\u00e9ration s\u2019av\u00e8re plus d\u00e9licate, puisqu\u2019elle vise \u00e0 \u00e9galiser la barbe et \u00e0 en maintenir sa longueur. Les finitions sur les joues et le cou se font au rasoir. Afin d\u2019\u00e9viter le c\u00f4t\u00e9 n\u00e9glig\u00e9 que l\u2019on reproche souvent \u00e0 la barbe, il est important de l\u2019entretenir souvent.\nCouper r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement les poils juste au-dessus de la bouche pour \u00e9viter qu\u2019il ne viennent envahir votre sourire. Pour la longueur, optez pour une taille l\u00e9g\u00e8rement sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 celle de votre bouche.\nQuant au choix de la forme, il est vrai que certaines sont plus en vogue que d\u2019autres, mais l\u2019audace est de mise.\nPour finir, m\u00eame la barbe a besoin de soin. Dirigez vous vers chez Barbe-and-co.fr par exemple. Un vrai paradis pour les hommes \u00e0 barbe.\nQuel est votre avis sur la barbe ? Comment les porter et les entretenir ?

Alors qu\u2019il y a encore peu, on ne pouvait \u00eatre classe sans \u00eatre ras\u00e9 de pr\u00e8s, les tendances ont chang\u00e9.

L\u2019avantage principal, c\u2019est qu\u2019elle est sans prise de t\u00eate. Et si jamais vous voulez la reformer, n\u2019h\u00e9sitez pas \u00e0 la tailler l\u00e9g\u00e8rement, comme Kit Harington. A porter courte, \u00e9videmment.\nLa barbe de George Clooney : taill\u00e9e\nRestructurant votre visage, cette barbe requiert un entretien maximum. Soin et taillage r\u00e9guliers sont n\u00e9cessaires. En plus de donner l\u2019impression que vous \u00eates le Boss, la barbe taill\u00e9e fait de vous le m\u00e2le viril par excellence. La preuve avec Clooney.\nLa barbe de Zac Effron : mousquetaire\nLaiss\u00e9e de c\u00f4t\u00e9 un moment, la barbe mousquetaire revient fi\u00e8rement sur le visage des hommes. Arbor\u00e9e par Johnny Depp ou Ryan Gosling, seul le rasage est utile. Laissez donc le bouc prendre forme et taillez autour. Malgr\u00e9 son aspect n\u00e9glig\u00e9, elle s\u2019accorde avec tout.

Les ann\u00e9es qui passent peuvent apporter quelques d\u00e9sagr\u00e9ments, du type poils blancs. Heureusement, la coloration existe ! Mode d\u2019emploi.\n1 Appliquez le m\u00e9lange sur votre barbe s\u00e8che\nApplication longue dur\u00e9e, tenue simple et rapide, les colorations maison valent celles des professionnels ! Il existe quantit\u00e9 de produits colorants \u00e0 faire chez soi. Pr\u00e9f\u00e9rez toutefois les valeurs sures, comme JUST FOR MEN , num\u00e9ro 1 mondial de la coloration pour hommes. Sa formule sans ammoniaque n\u2019agresse pas vos poils et cible uniquement ceux qui sont gris.\nPremi\u00e8re \u00e9tape : appliquez directement le m\u00e9lange (un gel \u00e9pais dans un tube con\u00e7u sp\u00e9cialement pour ne pas goutter et adoucir les poils pendant la coloration) sur la barbe s\u00e8che, \u00e0 l\u2019aide du pinceau qui vous est fourni dans la bo\u00eete.\nSachez que les contenus des deux tubes s\u00e9par\u00e9s peuvent \u00eatre gard\u00e9s pour une prochaine utilisation (jusqu'\u00e0 2 mois de conservation).\n2 Laissez agir 5 minutes\nLaissez agir au maximum 5 minutes, sinon vous risqueriez d\u2019obtenir une teinte trop fonc\u00e9e. La coloration id\u00e9ale ne doit pas \u00eatre trop couvrante, elle doit laisser de la transparence. Avec JUST FOR MEN, on ne pourra pas remarquer le ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne, car sa formule unique cible uniquement les poils gris et laisse sa couleur naturelle \u00e0 votre barbe.\nIl est important de d\u00e9terminer avec soin la coloration appropri\u00e9e \u00e0 votre couleur naturelle. Si vous h\u00e9sitez entre deux teintes, choisissez la teinte la plus claire.\n3 Rincez et lavez votre barbe\nPour r\u00e9v\u00e9ler l\u2019\u00e9clat de votre couleur, rincez sous la douche \u00e0 l\u2019eau ti\u00e8de, et lavez votre barbe (pas de savon) \u00e0 l\u2019aide d\u2019un shampoing doux comme le SHAMPOING \u00e0 l\u2019Aloe vera de VITAMAN par exemple.\nEn savoir plus : pourquoi j\u2019ai les poils blancs ?\nAu fur et \u00e0 mesure que l\u2019on vieillit, les poils commencent \u00e0 grisonner. Avec l'\u00e2ge, on produit de moins en moins de m\u00e9lanine, les pigments de couleur. Les poils ne perdent pas tous leur pigmentation au m\u00eame moment. R\u00e9sultat : certains seulement deviennent blancs.\nSi la plupart des hommes n\u2019ont pas de poils gris avant l\u2019\u00e2ge de trente ans, certains commencent \u00e0 grisonner d\u00e8s l\u2019adolescence.\nElise Barbet\nVotre conseil beaut\u00e9 homme sp\u00e9cial Osez la coloration barbe ! sur Mencorner\nMencorner, sp\u00e9cialiste en cosm\u00e9tique et mode pour homme, peut r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 toutes vos questions en termes de beaut\u00e9 masculine.

            "13": "Se teindre la barbe, pourquoi, comment et quelle coloration ?\nIl n\u2019y a pas que les femmes qui peuvent jouer sur leur apparence pour \u00eatre belles et originales. Les hommes ont \u00e9galement la possibilit\u00e9 de se rendre encore plus attirants par de nombreux moyens, notamment la teinture de barbe .\nSe teindre la barbe, pour quelles raisons ?\nLa teinture de barbe n\u2019est pas une chose nouvelle dans le domaine de l\u2019esth\u00e9tique. Si les colorations pour cheveux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9es auparavant, des produits plus adapt\u00e9s aux poils du visage ont r\u00e9cemment fait leur apparition. Gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 leur composition de base, ces derniers ne pr\u00e9sentent aucun risque sur la peau faciale et ont \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7us pour agir efficacement sur des poils plus secs et plus \u00e9pais comme la barbe. Pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en kit, les produits en question permettent d\u2019obtenir un r\u00e9sultat plus satisfaisant. De plus, comme ils sont disponibles en plusieurs variantes, les hommes ont largement le choix en termes de couleurs et de teintes, en tenant compte de la couleur de leur peau, de leurs yeux, et de leurs cheveux. La teinture de barbe est souvent r\u00e9alis\u00e9e pour sortir de l\u2019ordinaire, appara\u00eetre plus jeune ou plus \u00e2g\u00e9, selon le choix, et \u00eatre \u00e0 la page par rapport aux nouvelles tendances.\nComment proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une teinture de barbe ?\nTout d\u2019abord, procurez-vous un kit de coloration dans les grandes surfaces ou aupr\u00e8s des centres sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9s en vente de produits de beaut\u00e9 (voir ci-dessous notre recommandation). Si vous avez la peau sensible, optez pour la formule \u00ab sans ammoniaque \u00bb. Commencez par appliquer le produit colorant sur la barbe s\u00e8che en utilisant le petit pinceau fourni dans le kit. Laissez reposer cinq minutes, ou un peu plus si vous voulez d\u2019une teinte plus fonc\u00e9e. Apr\u00e8s le temps de pause, rincez la barbe \u00e0 l\u2019eau ti\u00e8de jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que l\u2019eau de rin\u00e7age soit claire et propre. Tout de suite apr\u00e8s, versez-y du shampooing doux et laissez agir deux minutes avant de rincer \u00e0 nouveau. Le shampooing fera ressortir l\u2019\u00e9clat de la couleur choisie et adoucira les poils pr\u00e9alablement impr\u00e9gn\u00e9s de produit colorant.\nDes astuces pour une teinture de barbe sans risque\nLa teinture de barbe n\u2019est pas difficile, mais il faut tout de m\u00eame suivre les instructions fournies dans le kit pour ne pas s\u2019exposer \u00e0 un risque quelconque. Comme la peau du visage est fragile et d\u00e9licate, un test d\u2019allergie doit donc avoir lieu avant de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la teinture. Il suffit pour cela d\u2019appliquer un \u00e9chantillon du produit de coloration sur une petite partie de la peau, derri\u00e8re les oreilles par exemple. En cas de rougeur ou de bouton, la teinture ne devrait pas \u00eatre r\u00e9alis\u00e9e. Si la brosse fournie dans le kit ne convient pas, une brosse \u00e0 dents peut \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e pour simplifier l\u2019application du produit.\nO\u00f9 trouver des produits de coloration de barbe ?\nLa marque Just For Men propose un gamme de produits de coloration de barbe.

            "22": "Lubumbashi, Le\u00a0 02 mai 2006\nSi l'annonce de la candidature de Joseph Kabila n'a certes surpris personne, ce f\u00fbt pourtant une belle occasion pour ses milliers de sympathisants \u00e0 manifester la joie de voir leur \u00ab meilleur profil \u00bb rompre le suspens qui devenait pour eux de plus en plus insupportable. Alors que certains affirment qu'il reste jusque l\u00e0 le meilleur et l'id\u00e9al portait robot du Pr\u00e9sident de la R\u00e9publique d'apr\u00e8s les \u00e9lections, d'autres, par contre, n'y vont pas par le dos de la cuill\u00e8re, en affirmant avec tout le s\u00e9rieux d'un pape, que sa place se trouve partout ailleurs, sauf, \u00e0 la t\u00eate du Grand, majestueux et puissant Congo. Les arguments pour d\u00e9montrer cette th\u00e8se abondent, voire surabondent jusqu'\u00e0 affirmer que Joseph Kabila n'est pas encore suffisamment mature pour pr\u00e9sider aux destin\u00e9es d'un Congo post-conflit o\u00f9 les affaires de l'Etat ne seront plus trait\u00e9es selon la th\u00e9orie et les principes, de la loi de la jungle o\u00f9 l'on profite de la pluie pour uriner dans la cour. Pour avoir tenu pendant cinq ans \u00e0 la t\u00eate du pays, peut-il gouverner apr\u00e8s les \u00e9lections selon les r\u00e8gles de l'art? Non. Car pendant la p\u00e9riode des conflits, le Congo a \u00e9t\u00e9 dirig\u00e9 de l'ext\u00e9rieur et\u00a0 chacun des acteurs politiques ob\u00e9issait aux ordres venus des commanditaires de la guerre et de grandes puissances, \u00e0 travers le CIAT. Par cons\u00e9quent, il ne fallait pas de grands efforts intellectuels et humains pour s'en sortir. Il ne suffisait que d'ob\u00e9ir, ob\u00e9ir aux injonctions, ob\u00e9ir aux ordres. Et tout allait comme sur des roulettes\u0085\nLe CIAT sera-t-il \u00e9ternellement l\u00e0 pour assister le futur Pr\u00e9sident de la R\u00e9publique \u00e9lu pour g\u00e9rer et conduire le pays ? Voil\u00e0 qu'encore une fois, la question des aptitudes r\u00e9elles de Joseph Kabila se pose. Et un psychologue essaie, en sa mani\u00e8re de porter un autre regard sur le Pr\u00e9sident de la R\u00e9publique, le d\u00e9cortiquer par sa mani\u00e8re de se pr\u00e9senter.\nJOSEPH KABILA PEUT-IL GOUVERNER SANS RECEVOIR DES INJONCTIONS ?\nC'est possible mais il faudrait attendre dix ans pour qu'il soit \u00e0 m\u00eame de le faire, a affirm\u00e9 un psychologue. Il suffirait, pour s'en convaincre, de bien observer, car c'est par une extrospection sans complaisance que l'on d\u00e9c\u00e8lera ses grands traits de caract\u00e8re. L'extrospection, comprise dans le sens d'une observation faite sur un tiers, le sujet observ\u00e9 n'\u00e9tant pas le sujet observant. Et cette extrospection, l'on s'en doute, r\u00e9v\u00e8le ces secrets qui ne sont que de Polichinelle pour les plus avis\u00e9s. Aussi, affirme notre psychologue, le Pr\u00e9sident de la RDC se trouve encore \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de l'adolescence, p\u00e9riode de la vie d'un \u00eatre humain comprise entre l'enfance et l'\u00e2ge adulte. L'adolescence a ses faiblesses dont l'inconstance et l'absence de lucidit\u00e9 que d'autres appelleraient l'immaturit\u00e9. Il est bon de souligner ici que comme la jeunesse est un \u00e9tat d'esprit et non un aspect physique comme il peut y avoir des adultes de cinquante ans qui sont des \u00e9ternels adolescents. Et un adolescent a toujours besoin d'\u00eatre accompagn\u00e9 dans sa vie, sinon les d\u00e9g\u00e2ts, sur son chemin, peuvent \u00eatre n\u00e9fastes.\nJOSEPH KABILA SE RECHERCHE ENCORE\u0085\nC'est pendant l'adolescence qu'un jeune construit son image d'adulte de demain. Ainsi en est-il du Pr\u00e9sident congolais Joseph Kabila qui ne s'est pas encore forg\u00e9 totalement une personnalit\u00e9. C'est un homme fragile qui se recherche et qui n'a pas trouv\u00e9 de mod\u00e8le id\u00e9al \u00e0 proprement parl\u00e9. Aujourd'hui, il peut prendre Jacques Chirac pour mod\u00e8le, demain il se choisira un tel autre, car il ne sait pas tr\u00e8s bien ce qu'il cherche.\nIl doute sans cesse du choix de ses mod\u00e8les. Cette h\u00e9sitation assimilable \u00e0 une inconstance trahit un manque de confiance en soi. Ce t\u00e2tonnement r\u00e9v\u00e8le la face cach\u00e9e d'un apprenti sorcier qui apprend sur le tas, par essai et erreur.\nIl n'est pas encore un homme au sens propre du terme, plut\u00f4t quelqu'un qui cherche \u00e0 s'affirmer mais son regard le trahit en r\u00e9v\u00e9lant sa vraie face. James Kabarebhe le dit en d'autres termes dans J.A/L'Intelligent du 29 avril au 2 mai 2002, \u00ab \u0085 (Joseph) est timide. Il est incapable de regarder les gens en face. Je n'ai jamais per\u00e7u en lui une quelconque aptitude au commandement \u00bb. Aujourd'hui, tout le monde ou presque est d'avis qu'il n'est l\u00e0 que pour ex\u00e9cuter les ordres. Tant que l'h\u00e9ritier est encore enfant, dit la Bible, il ne diff\u00e8re en rien d'un esclave. Rien qu'\u00e0 voir le look sans cesse changeant du Chef de l'Etat congolais, on sait lui donner son v\u00e9ritable \u00e2ge psychique. Les fortes personnalit\u00e9s, les hommes de caract\u00e8re sont constants, m\u00eame dans leur look. Autrement dit, par leur fa\u00e7on de se pr\u00e9senter.\nC'est par sa petite moustache, \u00e9ternelle et terrifiante, qu'on reconnaissait toujours la force d'Hitler. Savimbi a gard\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 sa mort, la grande barbe. Qu'il fasse chaud ou froid, Yasser Arafat avait toujours son kefia. M\u00eame dans son lit d'h\u00f4pital, Mobutu avait sa canne et sa toque \u00e0 la port\u00e9e de la main. S'il est vrai que pierre qui roule n'amasse pas, mousse, il est aussi vrai que les hommes inconstants sont immatures.\nQuel est le vrai look du Pr\u00e9sident Joseph Kabila ? Difficile \u00e0 dire, difficile \u00e0 dessiner son vrai portrait robot. De tous les pr\u00e9sidents de la plan\u00e8te, il est le seul qui change de coiffure en moyenne une fois le mois. Il suffit qu'il n'apparaisse pas en public pendant deux semaines, il s'affichera soit avec une t\u00eate ras\u00e9e comme un moine bouddhiste, soit avec une barbiche poivre sel \u00e0 la Koffi Olomide, avec une petite tache blanche, et m\u00eame avec une t\u00eate couverte d'une fine chevelure avec une moustache bon chic, bon genre et de fois, sans moustache, sans barbe mais seulement avec une fine chevelure. Loin d'avoir \u00e0 faire avec un suspect qui change r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement de coiffe pour passer inaper\u00e7u, on a plut\u00f4t affaire \u00e0 quelqu'un qui malgr\u00e9 son \u00e2ge, n'a pas encore acquis de maturit\u00e9. En d'autres termes, son \u00e2ge psychique n'est pas proportionnel \u00e0 son \u00e2ge biologique, il est en retard par rapport \u00e0 son \u00e2ge biologique. Ce qui peut amener \u00e0 affirmer qu'il est \u00ab un adolescent de 35 ans \u00bb. Parce que l'une des caract\u00e9ristiques de l'adolescent, c'est effectivement le manque de constance.\nLa physionomie, m\u00eame de visage, refl\u00e8te les grands traits de caract\u00e8re d'une personne. Ainsi en est-il de la forme de la t\u00eate, de la mani\u00e8re de regarder, de la forme et de la quantit\u00e9 de la barbe et m\u00eame du type de nez et de la bouche.\nQuand il garde une grande barbe, on peut lui donner facilement les grands traits des barbus. Tel Samora Machel, Sam Nujoma, Fidel Castro, Jonas Savimbi, Thabo Mbeki, Yerodia ou Jeannot\nMwenze Kongolo, il veut se faire passer pour un grand maquisard qui, \u00e0 force de combats et d'\u00e9preuves, a su gagner la victoire en imposant ses d\u00e9sirata. Comme la barbe qu'il garde de fois n'est pas \u00e9ternelle, il serait erron\u00e9 de l'\u00e9lever, non seulement, au rang des barbus c\u00e9l\u00e8bres, mais de lui attribuer aussi leurs grands traits. Il se fait malheureusement que si la barbe \u00e9tait signe de bravoure et de sagesse, que dire du bouc ?\nQuand il se rend compte qu'il n'est pas bien dans la peau des barbus, il glisse dans les rangs des t\u00eates ras\u00e9es qui passent pour des grands id\u00e9ologues et hommes des principes. Parmi celles-ci, on trouve, Kroutchev, Ghandi et m\u00eame LD Kabila. Mais, on se rend vite compte que m\u00eame avec une t\u00eate bien ras\u00e9e, Joseph est loin d'\u00e9galer les grandes t\u00eates ras\u00e9es. Il n'est qu'une imitation de t\u00eate ras\u00e9e.\nConscient de tout cela, il se m\u00e9tamorphose en imitant les moustaches qui sont les plus souvent caract\u00e9ris\u00e9es par la vigueur et la rigueur. Parmi ceux-ci, Boutefliika, Omar Bongo, Saddam Hussein, Leich Valesa\u0085\nMais, la moustache de Joseph est de toute autre nature. Elle d\u00e9montre que l'homme n'est pas de la trempe des autres moustaches.\nVoil\u00e0 l'explication \u00e0 cette m\u00e9tamorphose sans cesse fr\u00e9quente qui trahit son instabilit\u00e9. Il ne s'est pas encore fait une vraie personnalit\u00e9, il se recherche encore. Est-ce \u00e0 la magistrature supr\u00eame du pays qu'un homme doit chercher \u00e0 s'affirmer, \u00e0 se forger une personnalit\u00e9 ?\nCertaines indiscr\u00e9tions affirment que son passe-temps favori, c'est la natation\u0085 au jeu vid\u00e9o. Or, le Nintendo (jeu vid\u00e9o), c'est avant tout pour des personnes d'un \u00e2ge bien identifi\u00e9, qui serait l'\u00e2ge psychique de Joseph Kabila.\nEt quand le Chef d'Etat se recherche, il ne dirige pas. Ce sont d'autres qui dirigent \u00e0 sa place, qui l'influence \u00e0 leur guise, qui font semblant d'ob\u00e9ir \u00e0 ses ordres et qui en d\u00e9finitive, lui dictent la ligne \u00e0 suivre.\nUN CHEF COMPLEX\u00c9\nLe chef \u00e9tant conscient de ses limites, sachant qu'il n'est pas suffisamment outill\u00e9 mais comme il est le chef, il cherche \u00e0 s'affirmer autrement. De quelle mani\u00e8re le pourrait-il ? En parlant souvent avec ses interlocuteurs, la main plong\u00e9e la poche.         Il s'agit l\u00e0 pour lui d'une mani\u00e8re de prouver aux autres que malgr\u00e9 tout, \u00ab c'est moi le chef \u00bb. On a l\u00e0 un beau clich\u00e9 d'un complexe de sup\u00e9riorit\u00e9. L'homme, dans son subconscient, sachant qu'il est inf\u00e9rieur en tout ou presque, prend sa revanche en d\u00e9montrant que par la force du pouvoir, il est le ma\u00eetre absolu. Il contr\u00f4le tout. Il est au dessus de tous. Mais en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, cela n'est qu'une illusion. Puisque sa cour le sait pertinemment, elle s'adonne \u00e0 jouer au corbeau et au renard o\u00f9, tout flatteur devant vivre aux d\u00e9pens de celui qui l'\u00e9coute. Sa cours joue un peu \u00e0 l'hypocrisie, qui \u00e0 une certaine dose est signe d'ing\u00e9niosit\u00e9. D'o\u00f9, l'importance et la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de refaire le profit du Chef \u00e0 grands coups de pinceau : homme providentiel, sens d'\u00e9coute tr\u00e8s pouss\u00e9. Mais que cache tout cela ? Ce qu'on a \u00e0 faire \u00e0 un homme qui n'a pas encore la stature du Chef de l'Etat. Le jour o\u00f9 Joseph Kabila commencera \u00e0 devenir r\u00e9ellement un homme d'Etat, c'est ce jour qu'il apprendra effectivement \u00e0 se choisir un look, un seul.\nROGER KAS\nKatanga News\n\u00a9 Congo Vision\n\u00a0\n",

            "9": "There are three main patterns of hair loss for men. There is the receding hairline, the widow\u2019s peak (a specific type of receding hairline), and the bald spot. These can occur independently but usually over time a receding hairline and bald spot will occur. That\u2019s the bad news.\nThe good news is that there are hairstyles that minimize the appearance of hair loss.The key to all these hairstyles for thinning hair is the transition between hair and scalp. Check out these haircuts for thinning hair for men, in order from the earliest stages to later stages of hair loss.\nReceding Hairline\nUsually beginning at the temples, the hairline starts to move up the forehead until you\u2019ve got a fivehead. The exact pattern is a little bit different for everyone but these haircuts let you hang on to the hair you have for as long as possible.\nThe\u00a0Slick Back\nThis distinctive hairline can be a product of genetics or thinning hair. The peaked\u00a0hairline is nothing to hide. Try slicked back hair with some volume like\u00a0 Will Arnett \u00a0(but not like Nicholas Cage). This cut is about an inch all over but appears longer.\nThis is also a great choice for the initial stages of thinning hair at the crown. For guys with a receding hairline, a similar cut but styled slicked across instead of back or loose with fringe also works.\nThe\u00a0Blend\nAs hair continues to thin on top, surrounding hair looks thicker in contrast. If you don\u2019t want to go short, and you shouldn\u2019t feel like you have to, here\u2019s the cut for you.\u00a0 Louis CK \u00a0makes the most of his hair with a cut that subtly transitions from scalp to thin hair to full hair. Keep hair on the short side unless you\u2019re ready to embrace the power donut.\nThe Buzz\nAs hair loss advances, it\u2019s time to go shorter. If a shiny dome isn\u2019t your style, opt for a buzz like Jason Statham . The action movie star is a prime example of the relationship between testosterone and hair loss and he has handled it well. This buzz is one length all over so you can do it yourself. The beard is even shorter, balancing out less dense hair growth on top.\nPower Donut\nThe current men\u2019s trend is to shave it off but there was a time that the power donut \u00a0reigned. There\u2019s nothing wrong with going bald and it doesn\u2019t even\u00a0look bad (we\u2019re talking to you Trump). Wear the sides longer and slicked back like Ed Harris. With confidence, no will notice that anything is missing.\nBald Spot\nAlso called Type O male pattern hair loss for the shape that it takes on, the bald spot is the easiest to disguise, especially if you\u2019re tall. During the first stages of hair loss, long hair can be slicked back over top. This year\u2019s top hair trend will cover a thin spot for a while. When that no longer works, it\u2019s time for a shorter cut.\nLayering\nWhile his character Greg House has a full head of hair, Hugh Laurie is thinning at the vertex. For television, Laurie\u2019s hair is darkened with temporary color and filled in with a wig that matches his hair color and texture.\nLaurie does not bother with that routine in life. Instead, he has the most flattering haircut for a bald spot. It\u2019s a relatively short haircut all around. Hair is shortest around the thin patch of hair and gets longer towards the hairline. Messy styling also helps minimize the presence of a bald spot.\u00a0Style the cut with a lightweight product that gives some hold and texture but also allows for movement.\nPrince William \u2018s hair has thinned on top with exposed scalp\u00a0at the vertex. His current cut hangs onto length at the front for a wispy combover. The sides are layered to soften the transition from scalp to hair. It\u2019s a dignified way to handle hair loss.\nFacial Hair\nWalter White looked bad ass with his shaved head and goatee. Over the years, plenty of celebrities have embraced the bald with beard combination (as well as the power donut) including Patrick Stewart, Sean Connery, and Bruce Willis. For a more contemporart example, the shaved\u00a0head with beard is also\u00a0 Common \u2018s signature style. Bold glasses balance the look but are not required.\nThese are a few of the ways to cut hair for men thinning hair. Every style can be adapted for your hair type and to create a unique look.\u00a0As always, talk to your barber or stylist about your hair concerns and what you want. While many guys opt to go for the buzz when facing hair loss, plenty choose to hang on to their hair for as long as possible. Either way, with the hairstyles, you will look good.\n",

            "13": "There are three main patterns of hair loss for men. There is the receding hairline, the widow\u2019s peak (a specific type of receding hairline), and the bald spot. These can occur independently but usually over time a receding hairline and bald spot will occur. That\u2019s the bad news.\nThe good news is that there are hairstyles that minimize the appearance of hair loss.The key to all these hairstyles for thinning hair is the transition between hair and scalp. Check out these haircuts for thinning hair for men, in order from the earliest stages to later stages of hair loss.\nReceding Hairline\nUsually beginning at the temples, the hairline starts to move up the forehead until you\u2019ve got a fivehead. The exact pattern is a little bit different for everyone but these haircuts let you hang on to the hair you have for as long as possible.\nThe\u00a0Slick Back\nThis distinctive hairline can be a product of genetics or thinning hair. The peaked\u00a0hairline is nothing to hide. Try slicked back hair with some volume like\u00a0 Will Arnett \u00a0(but not like Nicholas Cage). This cut is about an inch all over but appears longer.\nThis is also a great choice for the initial stages of thinning hair at the crown. For guys with a receding hairline, a similar cut but styled slicked across instead of back or loose with fringe also works.\nThe\u00a0Blend\nAs hair continues to thin on top, surrounding hair looks thicker in contrast. If you don\u2019t want to go short, and you shouldn\u2019t feel like you have to, here\u2019s the cut for you.\u00a0 Louis CK \u00a0makes the most of his hair with a cut that subtly transitions from scalp to thin hair to full hair. Keep hair on the short side unless you\u2019re ready to embrace the power donut.\nThe Buzz\nAs hair loss advances, it\u2019s time to go shorter. If a shiny dome isn\u2019t your style, opt for a buzz like Jason Statham . The action movie star is a prime example of the relationship between testosterone and hair loss and he has handled it well. This buzz is one length all over so you can do it yourself. The beard is even shorter, balancing out less dense hair growth on top.\nPower Donut\nThe current men\u2019s trend is to shave it off but there was a time that the power donut \u00a0reigned. There\u2019s nothing wrong with going bald and it doesn\u2019t even\u00a0look bad (we\u2019re talking to you Trump). Wear the sides longer and slicked back like Ed Harris. With confidence, no will notice that anything is missing.\nBald Spot\nAlso called Type O male pattern hair loss for the shape that it takes on, the bald spot is the easiest to disguise, especially if you\u2019re tall. During the first stages of hair loss, long hair can be slicked back over top. This year\u2019s top hair trend will cover a thin spot for a while. When that no longer works, it\u2019s time for a shorter cut.\nLayering\nWhile his character Greg House has a full head of hair, Hugh Laurie is thinning at the vertex. For television, Laurie\u2019s hair is darkened with temporary color and filled in with a wig that matches his hair color and texture.\nLaurie does not bother with that routine in life. Instead, he has the most flattering haircut for a bald spot. It\u2019s a relatively short haircut all around. Hair is shortest around the thin patch of hair and gets longer towards the hairline. Messy styling also helps minimize the presence of a bald spot.\u00a0Style the cut with a lightweight product that gives some hold and texture but also allows for movement.\nPrince William \u2018s hair has thinned on top with exposed scalp\u00a0at the vertex. His current cut hangs onto length at the front for a wispy combover. The sides are layered to soften the transition from scalp to hair. It\u2019s a dignified way to handle hair loss.\nFacial Hair\nWalter White looked bad ass with his shaved head and goatee. Over the years, plenty of celebrities have embraced the bald with beard combination (as well as the power donut) including Patrick Stewart, Sean Connery, and Bruce Willis. For a more contemporart example, the shaved\u00a0head with beard is also\u00a0 Common \u2018s signature style. Bold glasses balance the look but are not required.\nThese are a few of the ways to cut hair for men thinning hair. Every style can be adapted for your hair type and to create a unique look.\u00a0As always, talk to your barber or stylist about your hair concerns and what you want. While many guys opt to go for the buzz when facing hair loss, plenty choose to hang on to their hair for as long as possible. Either way, with the hairstyles, you will look good.\n",

            "15": "40 Goatee Styles Trending in 2016\nOne of the most popular facial hair styles out there is the goatee. There are plenty of goatee styles available right now and it\u2019s clear to see why. There\u2019s a type of goatee for every age, skin color and face shape. Business men, workers, college students and hipsters all love the goatee look. Even celebrities can\u2019t get enough of this manly look, sporting a goatee regardless of the year and fashion trends.\nBut goatee styles require maintenance so get ready to put your shaving skills to the test. \u00a0You will need a beard trimmer and you have to decide which goatee shape to go for but other than that you are good to go.\n1.\u00a0Robert Pattinson Goatee Style\nIt looks like Robert Pattinson gave in to the goatee style look.

So feel free to try out different looks with or without a mustache, depending on your face type.\n8. The Laid Back Look\nMore and more hipsters are into goatee coloring to look older. You can actually dye your goatee any color that you can think of, but if you want to achieve the laid back look better go for grey goatees.\n9. Styling a Goatee\nBeards, goatees and mustaches all need to be styled. It may take a little extra time from your part, but in the end it\u2019s worth it.\n10.

Black Men Goatee Styling\nBlack mens goatee styles lean more towards an audacious look; a daring goatee trim that can be spotted from miles away.\n15. Thin Goatee\nThe thin goatee style is recommended for older men who want to look younger. It\u2019s a very low maintenance goatee style that is worth a chance.\n16. Full Goatee Style\nThe lumberjack look has received a modern retouch. It is also recognized thanks to the full goatee style that highlights one\u2019s masculinity.\n17. Relaxed Goatee\nWhat men seem to appreciate the most when it comes to best goatee styles is the fact that any goatee look can be altered as to flatter one\u2019s facial features. This unique trait can make any man feel good about himself.\n18. The Gray Goatee\nStyling beards isn\u2019t that hard; especially when the beard is highlighted by a perfect goatee. Older men can look incredibly handsome when sporting such a fine goatee.\n19. Ryan Reynolds\u2019 Hunk Look\nYou can shave your goatee or let it look a bit messy.

Mel Gibson\u2019s Daring Goatee\nMel Gibson shows that long goatee styles can be one inspired choice. Goatee and mustache styles have been around for quite some time and many actors have decided to revive this look because it is associated with manliness.\n21. Mustache and Goatee Style\nStyling a goatee can be tricky at times; this is why you should go to a barber\u2019s salon first and go for what the stylist recommends you in terms of length, shape and hair care. You should know that the best goatee beard styles for men are the ones that come with a fabulous mustache.\n22. Bradley Cooper\u2019s Take on Goatees\nShort goatee styles can easily pass as the five o\u2019clock shadow. Bradley Cooper is a big fan of the all-American, masculine look and he definitely owns that goatee.\n23. The Pirate Look\nOrlando Bloom looks like a bad guy which proves that short goatees can be very versatile and the difference is marked by style, attitude and face shape.\n24. So Classy, So Beautiful\nMens goatee styles are appropriate in various contexts from business appointments to formal meetings or casual dates and whatnot. Fawad Khan\u2019s goatee is close to perfection.\n25. Wide Goatee Types\nStylists recommend men with long, oval shaped faces to go for any goatee style because their facial features are more flattered this way.\n26. Beards Are In\nBeards have been trending for years now. Add a stylish goatee and you can nail one inspired look.\n27. With or Without Glasses\nThe good thing about beard and goatee styles is the fact that this facial hair look goes well both with and without glasses.\n28. Freestyle Goatee\nGoatees don\u2019t need too much styling. If you want to trim a goatee, remember that you can do so only when your facial hair is dry.\n29. Chris Evans\u2019 Elegant Look\nA well-trimmed goatee can make you stand out in the crowd. Chris Evans is the living proof that goatees can be the perfect ingredient to an elegant look.\n30.

The Typical Look\nGoatees have started as facial hair growing on a man\u2019s chin. In time, due to its increasing popularity, the goatee has suffered numerous changes.\n33. Undercuts and Goatees\nThe hairstyle is as important as the goatee itself so if you plan on drawing people\u2019s attention, go for an undercut to match a thick goatee.\n34. David Beckham, the Trendsetter\nEverybody perceives David Beckham as a fashion icon and he certainly deserves this title. His type of goatee is recommended for guys with round faces.\n35. Modern Goatee Style\nMost goatee styles for men are a modern interpretation of the old ones. There are so many different styles of beards and goatees, thus helping any man find the right style for him. This is the main purpose of a modern goatee style.\n36. Thick Goatee\u00a0\nThere are plenty of goatee styles for older men. Most of them are low-maintenance and require regular trimming but that\u2019s about it.\n37. Goatee without Mustache\u00a0\nSome men prefer a goatee without a mustache and the look goes well with casual fashion styles best.\n38. The Long, Manly Goatee\nThis kind of goatee beard style requires more maintenance but it is worth the trouble nevertheless.\n39. Bryan Cranston Is Too Cool for You\nBryan Cranston proves how inspired a goatee can be for a bald, older man.\n40. Man Buns and Goatees\nAnother inspired choice is highlighting a goatee by going for a man bun. It\u2019s a trending look and it may not last for too long, but it is certainly worth a shot.\nLeave a Reply\nComment\nName *\nEmail *\nWebsite\nPopular Posts\n60 Military Haircut Ideas In the past couple of years, the military haircut has\u2026\n",

            "18": "The 2014 elections\u2019 biggest IOUs\nThursday, November 6, 2014 12:14\n% of readers think this story is Fact.  Add your two cents.\nRep.-elect Tom MacArthur\u2019s campaign tops the post-election debtors\u2019 list. (Photo credit: MacArthur campaign)\nIt\u2019s been less than 48 hours since polls closed in the midterm elections, but for some candidates it\u2019s high time to get back on the fundraising horse.\nIn the most expensive midterm cycle of all time, many candidates borrowed heavily to keep their congressional hopes afloat. As of the most recent filings available with the Federal Elections Commission, which cover through the end of the third quarter and \u2014 for most candidates \u2014 the first two weeks of October, the campaign committees of this year\u2019s candidates for Congress collectively owed $100 million.\nWe found a total of $74,249,398 owed by the campaigns of 494 candidates for the House of Representatives:\nWhile the campaigns of 101 candidates for Senate owed $27,314,682:\nMost campaigns that took on debts weren\u2019t rewarded for their efforts. Sunlight found 182 losing candidates with $50,000 or more in reported debts.\nAtop of the red ink leader board: 22 committees that owed $1 million or more in their most recent financial reports. Most of the biggest debtors, however, owe money to the candidates they represent.\nTake Congressman-elect Tom MacArthur for example, a Republican who won Rep. John Runyan\u2019s old seat in southern New Jersey. A wealthy former executive of a risk management firm, MacArthur dug into his own pockets to fuel his campaign in Jersey\u2019s Third District , where the tight general election between MacArthur and Aimee Belgard pushed total spending in that race to over $10.5 million dollars.\nNow MacArthur\u2019s campaign committee owes him $5 million.\nOther candidates who poured millions into their campaign, include former Fortune 500 CEO Mark M. Jacobs , who ran for Senate in Iowa and Paul Mitchell III in Michigan\u2019s 4th District and Matthew Doheny in New York\u2019s 21st District. All of them lost and, like MacArthur, have seven-figure debts to show for it. But unlike MacArthur, they will have to try to recoup their losses without the benefits of incumbency and the debt retirement parties it brings.\nCandidates who have ascended Capitol Hill now have the added fundraising cach\u00e9 belonging to a member of Congress, making them a bigger target for beltway PACs and lobbyists.\nAn invitation collected by Political Party Time show that the biennial post-election ritual has already begun.\nTom Cotton, a new Republican addition to the Senate from Arkansas, is asking Washington supporters for $500 to $5,000 for admission to a fundraiser at Johnny\u2019s Half Shell , a favorite cash-raising haunt of members of Congress.\nThe figures in the tables above reflect the loans reported as of the committee\u2019s most recent report to the Federal Election Commission. Candidate committees are not required to file a \u201cpre-election\u201d report if the candidate did not advance to the general election.\nVisit Sunlight\u2019s Real-Time Federal Campaign Finance tracker to see House and Senate summary pages for the most up-to-date campaign figures.\nContributing: Jacob Fenton and Palmer Gibbs\nPortions copyright \u00a9 2017 Temporal Media, Inc., All Rights Reserved.\nBefore It's News\u00ae is a registered Service Mark of Temporal Media, Inc..\nIf you really want to ban this commenter, please write down the reason:\n",

Learn hair care, styling tips, and browse pictures gallery of popular hot mens hair styles from short to long, from straight to curly, and from classic to the latest modern hairstyles.\nby Karl\nWhile we live in a world that places a lot of primacy on physical looks where having a crop of abundant hair at the top of your is thought as one of the important expression of masculine style, there are some who have gone against the grain. There is no shortage of bald successful and sexy men who have made it in a variety of fields; from acting to sports and even academia. Here is a brief profile of Top 25 Famous Sexy Bald Men in no particular order.\nMichael Jordan\nWhen it comes to sportsmen, there are a countable few to stand alongside Michael Jordan in terms of how they have influenced men\u2019s style. It is not just Jordan\u2019s line of Nike sports shoes that have become a legacy for the former Chicago Bulls prodigy, his style off the court has mesmerized and awed in equal measure. His dress sense is impeccable and there are few who exude as much machismo whether dressed in a tuxedo or sports kit.\nJason Statham\nAlthough in mid-forties, Jason Stratham soldiers on in his acting career. His talent and incredible screen charm no less captivating as his advancing years or receding hairline would seem to suggest. Besides his acting heroics, few fans know that Jason is also an avid athlete and that he finished twelfth in the 1992 diving world championships.\nVin Diesel\nBorn as Oscar Sinclair Vincent, Vin Diesel is an American actor, director and writer of mixed parentage. Due to his heritage, Vin had early difficulties in finding good roles and today prefers to call himself as \u2018multicultural\u2019. In a television interview, he revealed that he changed his name to Vin Diesel when he worked as a bouncer, a profession he says one should not give out his real name. The Diesel part of his moniker was given to him by his friends who said he must run on diesel because of his boundless energy.\nBruce Willis\nThe German-born American actor known as Bruce Willis is a legend of the big screen whose enduring charm and sex appeal has enthralled generations of cinema lovers for decades today. Bruce Willis is also a singer and has released several albums besides starring in a number of television shows. As a measure of his stature amongst Hollywood legends, the movies he has featured in have grossed well over 3 billion dollars, making him the sixth highest grossing star in a lead role and eighth when supporting roles are brought into reckoning.\nAndre Agassi\nFor years, Andre Agassi held crowds mesmerized with his tennis court heroics. However few tennis enthusiasts know that the prodigy of the clay court wore a wig as he won the 1990 French Open. You have to sympathize with him though considering that at the time he was only twenty at the time. Today, the retired star has come into terms with his hair loss and rarely even spots any facial growth. And his appeal on the social scene has not been any less prodigious for the lack of hair.\nSamuel L Jackson\nSamuel Jackson has risen up in stature both as a cultural icon and screen star since he featured in a series of films in the early nineties. He is also a professional golfer as well as a family man. His success is no less phenomenal as he advances in years and his charm and commanding presence can be expected to offer entertainment and inspiration for cinema goers well into the foreseeable future.\nFrederick \u201cFreddie\u201d Ljungberg\nNobody can question Freddie Ljungberg\u2019s skill with the soccer ball. He made it on to the big stage with his mesmerizing dribbles and runs in opposition defenses. As his hairline receded at the prime of his careers, Ljungberg never shied off and decided to shave it close to his head. He never does cut it of altogether, but retains it close enough. In the twilight years of his career in the Major League Soccer, Ljungberg has continued to be prominent in the social scene and considering the beauties he has continued to attract; his loss of hair has never been an issue for his amazing sexual appeal.\nZinedine Zidane\nHis infamous head but in the final of the 2006 World Cup in Germany has been used on numerous occasions as an unfortunate blemish on an otherwise illustrious career. The achievements of Zinedine Zidane playing either for the top European clubs like Real Madrid and Juventus in the 1990\u2019s and 2000\u2019s. The fact that he showed no less prodigy as his baldness cropped up on his head means that loss of hair should never be an encumbrance to one\u2019s lofty goals. And it in no way lessens a man\u2019s appeal.\nTyson Beckford\nIf there is a man that has come to define the paradigm \u2018less is more\u2019 there is none like Tyson Beckford. The actor cum model has urbane good looks that are not in the least lessened by the fact that he features a clean shaven head. Forget the pronounced tattoos and the rippling abs that are reason enough why Tyson is such a heartthrob. The bald head is a big reason why he is considered such a heartthrob by smitten girls all around the globe.\nTaye Diggs\nEver since he made it on to the global stage with his unforgettable performance in How Stella Got Her Groove Back, Taye Diggs has continued to pull off some amazing stunts of convincing acting. The fact that he sports a shiny head top of the head has not made his performance nor appeal any less intriguing. If anything, his baldness has come to cap off his talent and screen presence. Facial hair aside (of which he has been known to experiment with several styles) Taye\u2019s maintenance free hairstyle is as worth of mention as his disarming smile.\nBen Kingsley\nBen Kingsley is perhaps most well known around the world for his leading role in Richard Attenborough\u2019s movie Gandhi in 1982. For his performance, Kingsley won a slew of awards including the Golden Globe and the Best Actor in the Academy Awards. His performance in portraying Itzhak Stern in the 1993 blockbuster, Schindler\u2019s List proved that this urbane bald headed actor has class about him. He continues to star in a number of films in the twenty first century too and has even been knighted for his endeavors.\nSean Connery\nIt is a fact that sounds like an incredible piece of fiction when fans of James Bond come to know that the first actor to ever bear this iconic moniker wore a toupee to cover his baldness in all his movies. The pioneering agent 007 has achieved what many can only dream of even aspiring to have in a lifetime. Other than a stream of award winning movies that have been the hallmark of his acting career spreading well over three decades, Sean Connery has been knighted by the Queen and has consistently been voted one of the sexiest men alive despite being much older than the prevailing modern sex symbols. His authenticity cannot be questioned though, he has always retained his endearing Scottish accent irrespective of the movie he is featuring in.\nMichael Chiklis\nWith his evocatively rugged looks, Michel Chiklis is one of those television actors whose sexual appeal will continue to enthrall fans for many years to come. Born in 1963, his age and receding hairline have not diminished his commanding screen presence. The quintessential cop in a number of leading drama series has never shied from expressing his revulsion for hair growth adverts. To him it is criminal to treat hair loss as if it was the worst possible happenings that could happen to a man.\nWoody Harrelson\nEven his recent portrayal of Woody Harrelson in the movie The Hunger Games may have brought out a distinctly shaggy haired look, in real life Woody Harrelson spots much less growth on top of his head. This loss of hair has not meant that the veteran actor has any less appeal and charm. It is a safe bet that when the hunkiest rugged men are counted, Woody will be there at the top with the best of them.\nSeal\nWith his unconventional looks and irrepressibly melodic voice have been the hallmarks of the incredibly talented singer known as Seal. Born as Seal Henry Olusegun Olumide Adeola Samuel of Brazilian and Nigerian heritage, he has won just about every award there is to win in showbiz from Brits to Grammies to MTV video awards. Seal has always been a subject of speculation in the media and his enormous sexual appeal is evident from the fact that he has dated the most highly rated actresses including German model Heidi Klum whom he married in 2005 and the couple only came to separate in early 2012.\nLL Cool J\nWhen the history of Rap music is told, there will be a large chapter on LL Cool J. He is credited with the role of moving the genre from the underground to the mainstream of entertainment circles. He has further enhanced his reputation as an actor with a number of global successes like Any Given Sunday. Though he invariably spots trendy head gear, he nonetheless concedes that he spots a balding head.\nPatrick Stewart\nTaking his staid facial appearance and bald head, one would be forgiven for underestimating the talent of Patrick Stewart. However, follicular shortcomings have not derailed the achievements of the star of Star Trek. For over seven years and in 178 episodes of the award winning TV series, Steward went on to achieve phenomenal success with the X-men franchise. His bald head did not stop him from being voted among the 50 most beautiful people in the world by People Magazine in 1995.\nHowie Mandel\nAny list of top 25 famous sexy bald men would be incomplete without mentioning Howie Mandel. He rose to worldwide fame with the phenomenal success of the Deal or No Deal game show but has returned to the television as a judge on America\u2019s Got Talent. Though earlier in his career Mandel used to spot a crop of funky, curly hair he has come to be known for his endearing bald head today. Interestingly enough, Mandel has admitted that he shaved off his hair not because he was balding but because he suffers from mysophobia, a pathological fear of contamination and germs. Apparently, shaving his hair makes him feel cleaner.\nDamon Wayans\nWhen it comes to stand up comedy, there are few who have a natural gift for it to rival the truly prodigious Damon Wayans. His exploits on both the big and small screen are legendary and he is a household name all over the world, at least in homes where laughter is allowed. He is one of the top American sex symbols and his admirers invariably concede that his shiny head is a large part of why they find him irresistible.\nChris Daughtry\nThere has been questions raised in the media and blogosphere whether Chris Daughtry has male pattern baldness or not. However, everyone is in agreement that Chris is one hell of a sexy rock star. Making his mark on the showbiz stage at the American Idols, Chris Daughtry has gone on to achieve success post idols and was even nominated for a Grammy.\nJohn Travolta\nTrendsetter, action hero par excellence, heartthrob, evergreen, suave. All these are tags that immediately spring to mind when one thinks of one of the most enduring stars of Hollywood culture, John Travolta. What many people do not know is that Travolta also spots a much receded hairline than his movies show. He dons one of the most realistic hair pieces and with all that charm, who can question his little vanity?\nTyrese Gibson\nStill in his youthful thirties, Tyrese Gibson spots closely shaved hair that all the same has not diminished his sex appeal. When you consider that he is a rapper, R n B, singer, songwriter, actor and model, you have to wonder if it is possible for someone to have more going for them. Tyrese is certainly going places and with his hairstyle, he has scored a big point in a bid to cultivate a self-made image.\nYul Brynner\nThere are fewer enduring sex symbols of the showbiz industry to equal the magnetism and allure of Yul Brynner. The Russian stage and film actor is best known for his role as Mongkut in The King and I as well as Rameses in the 1956 epic, The Ten Commandments. Many years since he died he is still remembered for being one of the stars who have shown that sexy and hair loss are not necessarily mutually exclusive.\nMontel Williams\nAs an actor, radio show host and television personality, Montel Williams has enduring appeal for millions of American fans and many more around the world. His own Montel William Show has earned following among enthusiastic television audiences for close to two decades. He has also written a number of books.\nAvery Brooks\nTalented, sexy and as photogenic as they come; Avery Brooks has that capacity to draw attention on stage, screen or in printed media. He has won Awards in television, cinema, documentaries and theater. Brooks has also been a teacher and has made notable contributions in promotion of African American cultural heritage.\nRelated Posts:\nComment\nName *\nEmail *\nWebsite\nRecent Posts\n",

If you think you're going bald and want to combat it, read /u/tripthree 's post Bald Guys: Your Hairline and Your SMV .\nMy Story\nI am in my late 20s and have been going bald since age 15. By age 20 I was a Norwood 4A when I finally made the decision to shave it off.\nYet...\nI have two 7/10 plates that I fuck silly on a regular basis.\nI've had women open me on Tinder saying they love bald men.\nI've had sex with 15 different women this year.\nHow do I do it?\nIt's Not Your Hair, It's Your Insecurity\nLet's get this out of the way. Yes, being bald is perceived as less attractive by women .  Life isn't fair. Some people are bald, some people are short, some people are introverts. Nearly everyone has one trait that makes them less attractive to women.\nYou know what the least attractive thing is to women, though? Insecurity. Women have a very high level of emotional intelligence and are extremely perceptive. If you're insecure about being bald, it's shining through to women, whether you notice or not.\nThe best way to combat insecurity is to ignore your weaknesses and capitalize on your strengths. Let's talk about how to do that.\nBaldness and Dominance\nUPenn professor Albert E. Mannes carried out three studies in 2012 where participants both viewed photos and read descriptions of men with hair and men with shaved heads.\nMen with shaved heads were perceived as more dominant, more confident, and more masculine.\nIt's not hard to see why this is the case: making the choice to shave your head indicates a \"don't give a fuck\" mentality. As professor Mannes muses in the study's background section, \"men who shave their heads violate a social norm that prizes hair\". By effectively giving up that which society holds most dear, people view you as rebellious, confident, and powerful.\nEstablishing a Dominant, Masculine, and Powerful Image\nLike it or not, we base attractiveness off of stereotypes. You are bald, so women already assume you're masculine, but if you don't display other masculine traits, they will be confused and you won't create attraction.\nPlaying into people's pre-existing sterotypes by establishing a masculine frame is key to creating attraction as a bald man.\nLift\nYes, you've read it before, but it applies triply so if you are bald. You don't just need to lift, you need to get huge.\nWho do you think women find more attractive, this guy or this guy ?\nGrow a Beard\nIf you can't grow a decent beard, keep it clean-shaven. No one likes a patchy beard. I can't grow a beard to save my life, so I keep it shaved.\nStyle\nThere are styles that work for bald guys and styles that don't. While, in general, the TRP advice of \"dress well\" works, fashion advice is a bit different for bald men.\nIn my experience, you want to combine dressing well with a few touches of \"bad boy\" added in. This means that dressing like you just got off a sailboat at Cape Cod isn't ideal. You want to integrate things like bomber jackets, Wayfarer sunglasses, leather, and shirts that show off some skin, as well as accessorize: earrings, tattoos, chains, and watches.\nA picture is worth a thousand words, so here's some ideas:\nFrame\nThis may be the most important one of all. You may be swagged to the teeth, jacked, and have a great beard, but if you act like a beta, women will see through your image immediately.\nYou need to back up your appearance with a strong, masculine, dominant frame. This means:\nAlpha text game. My go to line recently to a second date has been telling them to \"Wear something sexy\". Hasn't backfired on me yet. Read Heartiste and apply it.\nDominating girls in the bedroom. I slap my plates on the ass, grab their hips, and whisper in their ears about how hard I'm going to fuck them. Read The Sex God Method if you want to learn more.\nTalking slowly, with a low, authoritative, voice. There are plenty of resources here on TRP, simply search the subreddit for \"voice\".\nPractice amused mastery . If you're smiling, it's at her.\nDefuse shit tests like a boss. You may find that people will shit test you about your hair. Anecdotally, this hasn't happened to me in forever since I developed more confidence, but used to happen right about the time I started shaving it. At that time, I used a couple canned lines to defuse and make people laugh:\nGod only made so many perfect heads. He had to cover the uglier ones with hair.\nYeah, but on the flip side, I save tons of money on shampoo.\nConclusion\nThe key to success as a bald man is capitalizing on the masculine, powerful image that bald men are associated with. Change your style, be successful, fuck women. It works.\n10 months ago\n10 months ago\n10 months ago\n10 months ago\n10 months ago\n10 months ago\n10 months ago\n10 months ago\n10 months ago\n10 months ago\n10 months ago\nI have a buddy who is pretty short. Like 5'4\" maybe shorter. He pulls better than most guys who are in the mid 5s, like 5'8\" 5'10\". How does he do this? He owns his shortness. He doesn't lack for confidence at all and if anyone ever makes a joke about it (which rarely happens) he always says \"Bruhh I just want a woman who is 6'2\" or taller; straight up climb her\". He also works out diligently is in great shape and is always doing cool stuff.\nI feel like the same thing can be said for someone who is bald. I can't emphasize the frame fact any more than what is in here. Own the baldness, be the \"bald-guy\", have a sense of humor about it. Women will love the confidence more and the baldness will become a non-issue.\n10 months ago\n10 months ago\n10 months ago\nWhen Alexander the Great met Diogenes, he asked if there was anything the Emperor could do for the philosopher, who was living in a barrel at the time, seldom bathed and masturbated in public. Diogenes responded \"You can get out my sunlight.\"\nAlexander remarked \"If I were not Alexander, I would wish to be Diogenes.\"\nDiogenes said \"If I were not Diogenes, I would also wish to be Diogenes.\"\nHe owned it, he gave no fucks, and the Ultimate Alpha, Alexander, envied him.\nEdit: Clarity\n10 months ago\n10 months ago\n10 months ago\n9 months ago\n10 months ago\n10 months ago\n10 months ago\n9 months ago\n10 months ago\n\"Women have a very high level of emotional intelligence and are extremely perspective.\"\nNot to be THAT guy, but I think the word you are looking for is perceptive.\nGreat post by the way.. I have a full head of hair, but as you say, every man has at least ONE thing that could be considered a turn-off for women. Ultimately, though, it does not matter one bit. Just be confident, love yourself, and appreciate what you do have. Women can smell insecurity from a mile away, like it's blood in the water; They are sharks. It helps if you spend a little time every day standing in front of the mirror and giving yourself positive affirmations. Just tell yourself how goddamn handsome and sexy you are, and your confidence will begin to increase. Also, take the necessary steps and do the work to look good.. i.e. Lift, dress well, take care of yourself. Everything else will work out, and worst case if some bish isn't feeling you? There are more.. EVERYWHERE.\n10 months ago\nAgree wih you 100% @corsega,\nThis whole thing where guys obsess over hair loss comes from guys  projecting their sexual likes onto women.\nA guy would be turned off by a bald woman, so he assumes a woman would be turned off by a bald guy.\nNot the case. Women are turned on by six-packs, hard ass, chisled jaw (sign of high testosterone) and they like a tough-guy, dominant look: which the bald tough-guy image can provide.\nGuys need to stop going on assumptions that are really just projections of their own sexuality onto women.\nStart learning what women actually like.\n10 months ago\n10 months ago\n10 months ago\n9 months ago\n10 months ago\n10 months ago\n10 months ago\n10 months ago\n10 months ago\nHey, if you shave your head, you can also grow out a goattee and have my old job as \"Official Spokesman For the 90s\". /grin\nMore seriously, a lot of women dig the shaved head with beard look.\n10 months ago\n10 months ago\nAll credit to you for the \"wear something sexy\" text line, by the way.\nIf I'm feeling it, I will tell a girl \"Be sure to wear pretty underwear for me.\" Delivered casually, almost as an afterthought, and in a way that she doesn't know if I'm joking or not, that line is both subtle and unsubtle.  You can always claim you were bullshitting, but at the same time it put the right idea in her head, i.e. you see her as a sexual creature and you want her to dress for you in an intimate way, and you WILL be seducing her later.  Lots-o-subtext going on.  She might protest, but - acta non verba - I have removed a lot of lacy confections after issuing that directive.\nI will always make a not of it to the girl and she will always say some version of how I told her to, or she wanted to look pretty for me.  IOW, she didn't have agency, she did what I told her to.  More subtext.\n10 months ago\n10 months ago\nTwo words: Jason Statham\nAt one point I decided that it was better to be bald than balding and I did it with a vengeance, sporting a van dyke (goatee) and wearing leather jackets and being the bad boy even as I built a respectable career.\nOne is that you have to own it. Second is that you need some facial aesthetics or lift and get a fit bod to back it up. And then you need a marketable attitude. Bad boy works for some, strong stoic type for others or maybe the intellectual type.  Play your strengths.\n10 months ago\n10 months ago\nI am pretty bald. I shave to a zero bit not skin. I do fine. But I'm also not ugly. Bald is fine if you have the SMV to go with it. Bald itself doesn't rob too much from SMV if other areas are dialed in. But being bald and a pussy/wimp/ugly/ is just more of a death sentence.\nRemember men, it's already tough enough to date out of your SMV league. Do everything you can to elevate your looks, money, status to get laid. It's that simple. There will inevitably be women who won't bang you. Who cares. Bang the ones you can.\n10 months ago\n10 months ago\nOne of my plates is 20 years old. 5'3\", 105 pounds, former beauty pageant contestant.\nHad her over a couple days ago and, as I'm fingering her, she started moaning and kissing my head. I got a huge kick out of it.\nYou are only limited in what you achieve by your own beliefs.\n10 months ago\n9 months ago\n10 months ago\n9 months ago\n9 months ago\n9 months ago\nWell man if I ever saw at least an IOI from any female, no matter what the rating would be I'd try to.\nThe fact that I've ever barely had any makes me think what I think, among other things.\n10 months ago\n10 months ago\nYou might be one of them - good for you\nOr in the more likely case you're just massively delusional and try to cope about your hairloss\n10 months ago\nAnytime a pretty boy gives me shit about being bald (I shave my head once a month and let it grow till the next time). I remind him my balls are likely far larger and my sex drive far greater. Last Sunday this happened. At wife's friend's house. Wife's friend's brother is in town with his family. Brother has long wavy hair and makes a comment about my baldness. With a bored tone I reply back \"my balls are bigger and better than yours. It's why I don't have that soft punk ass faggot hair you got. Perfect for pulling when someone makes you their bitch.\"\nHis wife bursts out laughing and the guy is eyeing me. Even with a week of viral gastritis having wrecked me (bench still went up five pounds so go figure) my arms are still three times thicker than his, and my shoulders and chest are far bigger than his. So he just sits their awkwardly. His wife asks if that is my \"thing\" making people feel uncomfortable. I tell her no, \"my thing is being an incredible fuck god.\" Followed by \"every woman should know what it is like to orgasm over a hundred times in under thirty minutes.\" The brother just sat there with an upset bitch face look and I'm making jokes at his expense. The wife started asking me for tips on how to make it happen and I had to throw in \"well, first you let me fuck you like I've just bought your ass and I have to break-it-in so you know you'll never find another man or device that plugs in the wall better than me.\"\nMy wife was laughing along and taunting the brother's wife as well. Own it and have fun with it. God blessed you with excess testosterone which keeps you from looking like a power bottom queer bitch.\n10 months ago\n10 months ago\nLegit lmfao. Just lol at his immense butthurt.\nThis incel would trade ALL of his \"muh masculinity\" bullshit if it would give him a full head of hair. Poor bastard.

As a bald man you want dimensions, and angularity within the face to make up for the bald head.  When you grow a beard with a balding head you essentially look like a egg-potato.\nDesigner stubble can look good when it's maintained.\n\u00a0\n0\n\u00a0\n74\nOnly men with masculine looking  chromes can pull it off.

It depends on the person and head shape.  Some people like myself have younger looking faces regardless of weight and a beard typically helps babyfaced guys look more masculine.\n\u00a0\n74\nLOL.   right because  most men have such a god tier facial structure like that.   Lemme re-arrange my chromosomes so I can have a massive, chin and jaw followed by a square chrome.   while im at it,  Im going to make eyes look like a hunter, and give myself deep set eye, brow and heavy bridge.\nJeez christ.   Talk about extreme examples.   That's even considered a beard.   Heavy stubble.\nNot  to mention that guy most likely exercises heavily. I can tell by his facial structure, and leanness .     Athletic.\na better example\nYour examples are extreme the other way.\nFor every bearded guy with a potato or egg head look like the 2 pics that you posted, there are 5 that look fine.\nMaybe not great but at least average-looking.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYour examples are extreme the other way.\nFor every bearded guy with a potato or egg head look like the 2 pics that you posted, there are 5 that look fine.\nMaybe not great but at least average-looking.\nClick to expand...\nits dependent on the effort you put in. Look at the guys who look good in this category. Usually they are tall (less important) and very fit. If you are rocking this look you BETTER work out. Look at the jawline of that guy in the pic 3 posts up. Hes def a fit guy. Look at the neck and shoulders.\nThe fact is again if you are bald you do DEF have to work harder than the next guy.\nImagine you are in a public place and there is the better looking guy one of the two lesser attractive guys and a pretty girl. both guys go up to her. She will more than not leave and go to another place without handing out her info. If there was an attractive guy with hair theres a better possibility of her giving him a phone number or hanging around to talk.\nBald makes you looks scary, trust me I know. Having that hair makes people look more accepting and friendly.\nAlso take into consideration photos are HORRIBLE proof. Video is better. Even I can take 1000 photos and find ONE I will post thats looks good. Professional models spend all day to get 1 or 2 good shots.

            "55": "197 Shares\n26 May, 2015\nIt affects around 70% of men in their lifetime.\u00a0And 25% of men will show the first signs of it by the ripe old age of 30. I\u2019m talking about\u00a0male-pattern baldness, or hair loss.\u00a0From thinning around the crown or temples to the fully-blown bald,\u00a0the statistics show that you\u2019re not alone in being follically-challenged.\nLet\u2019s the discuss issue and learn how to work around it in daily life \u2013 head on.\nBreaking It Down\nHair loss is caused by both environmental and genetic factors. Poor diet, stress, and not looking after yourself in general, fall into the former category; while the latter is hereditary and therefore, cannot be controlled.\nDefined as male-pattern baldness or androgenetic alopecia, this type of hair loss is caused by excess levels of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a male hormone that causes follicles to weaken and stop working altogether.\nAs a way of preparing yourself for future baldness, look to your genealogy \u2013 in particular, your maternal grandfather. The hair loss gene (like your height) is rumoured to be carried by mother\u2019s side, so look to her father as an indication of how much time you have left.\nWhether this true or not, you\u2019re likely to be one of the seven-out-of-ten men to experience some form of hair thinning or loss in your life.\nAccept It\nYour hairline has risen an inch in the last 12 months and you\u2019re starting to get paranoid; looking in the mirror incessantly for some sort of sign that it isn\u2019t so. Then, mates make a passing \u2018bald\u2019 joke as clumps of hair start blocking the shower drain as you wash your locks. It\u2019s happening. Rather than panic (stress causes hair loss, remember?), get a grip.\nHair doesn\u2019t make the man, it\u2019s just a natural asset, like having broad shoulders or a strong jawline. Draw comfort from the fact that some of the world\u2019s \u2018sexiest\u2019 men are bald or balding (heard of Jude Law, Bruce Willis or Jason Statham?). Mourn for 24-hours and move on.\nHere are some tips for balding hairstyles on how to face hair-loss and look good doing it.\nStyling & Preparation\nStyling thinning hair requires a good hair thickening shampoo (Kiehl\u2019s, Swell or Aveda are some examples) to boost each follicle. Use a wide-tooth comb to gently comb through thickening styling spray, and then follow with a good blow dry (the wind lifts the hair and adds volume).Lastly, apply a matte-based product (nothing oil-based) and mess around the strands for a fuller look.\nTip: Avoid roughly towel-drying your hair or over brushing the hair (especially when wet as the hair is weakest then).\nThe Receder\nWhen your hair line starts to recede it\u2019s time to go short. Head to a reputable barber or hair dresser and order the following: A short-back-and-sides cut with one to two inches of length on the top and an inch of length of the side. The trick is to keep the sides and back shorter to create the illusion of \u2018thicker\u2019 hair on top. This works well for men with the early onset of baldness, or those who still have the majority of their hair at the crown, back and sides.\nBuzz Cut\nThe buzz cut is especially good if your hair is starting to thin on the crown and top of your head, making you look more like a monk than a man. The buzz cut gives you a clean, yet edgy look with the length of the shave dependent on how severe the balding is. Ask for an all-over shave with a number 3 or 2 razor length.\nThese balding hairstyles looks doesn\u2019t require any styling, making it a foolproof, bad-ass look for the balding man.\nNaked Shave\nA very signature look, the naked shave is one of the balding hairstyles that is great for men who have are very bald with little, to know hair on the majority of their head. Head to the barber once again for this one (don\u2019t do a home job until you seek professional help) where the stylist can perform the sharpest shave to the skin without error.\nNow with a bald scalp, make sure you moisturise the head after showering and regularly shave it to keep it fresh and without fluff.\nAu Naturale\nSome men prefer to have a little\u00a0hair on their head, for fear of looking like a thug completely shaven. An option is to let whatever hair you have left grow out, keeping it trimmed and neat. Heading to the barber every four weeks is essential, keeping the hair groomed and tamed.\nThis method exudes a confidence in letting nature run its course and working the hair that you\u2019ve got left. Plus, it\u2019s a touch bohemian and artsy \u2013 if you\u2019re that way inclined.\nNo \u2018Comb Over\u2019\nAvoid the \u2018comb-over\u2019 like it never existed. It\u2019s not an option for the stylish gent. There\u2019s no hiding the fact you\u2019re balding on top so keep the sides short to downplay the hair areas against the bald ones. A comb-over screams a lack of confidence and like the toupee, actually accentuates your baldness. People will see right through it.\nGrow Facial Hair\nA lot of celebrities with thinning hair embrace facial hair. Hair around the chin, jaw and cheeks draws attention from your balding head. Important thing to note: moustaches and goatees work best, as opposed to lumberjack beards. A\u00a0full-blown beard adds too much weight to the lower part of the head/face, especially when paired with bald head.\nFinal Word\nHair isn\u2019t everything. Yes, it\u2019s become a huge part of the men\u2019s grooming canon in recent years, but being without hair relieves you of the stress of styling it each morning. Instead of obsessing over hair loss, focus your time and attention on orchestrating a killer outfit for work or the weekend \u2013 leaving colleagues and friends wishing their looked like you \u2013 hair, or no hair.\nEmail*\nSchedule\nDaily\nWeekly\nThis iframe contains the logic required to handle AJAX powered Gravity Forms.\nAccess exclusive content, be the first to know about giveaways\nand receive news before your mates.\nEmail*\nSchedule\nDaily\nWeekly\nThis iframe contains the logic required to handle AJAX powered Gravity Forms.\nGet International\nCustomise your D'Marge reading experience by selecting your preferred region below.\nWhere Next?\n",

            "57": "Generally, it is a norm for people to think that beard is only for those with a good looking hairstyle. But, like everything in this world, fashion trends too change with time. And Yes! Men with bald head too look good by sporting a beard or facial hairstyle that match their facial structure. Basically, there are two types of bald heads - permanent bald head and clean shaved head.\nIn the first type i.e., permanent bald head, there will be some hair on the sides of the head, whereas in the second type, it is completely hairless (those who choose to shave off a full head of hair).\nSo, it is very important to grow a beard style that balances your face shape and size so that you could attract the eyeballs towards your beard easily. You can give your personality an extra mile by sporting a cool beard style with the perfect dressing.\nDifferent Types of Beard Styles for Bald Heads\nYou can sport any of the below facial hairstyles for a trendy look. They are\nGoatee (Full or Classic)\n#1.Goatee\nHugh Jackman, who is popularly known for his role as a Wolverine in the X-Men series has got a completely new avatar (Blackbeard) for his role in the upcoming movie 'Pan'. He is sporting a beard style called 'Goatee' with twirled mustache and a shaved head. This facial hairstyle is also known as Van Dyke.\nThere are various styles of Goatee but everything falls under two categories - full goatee and classic goatee.\nThe full goatee is often seen in bikers, corporate people, construction men, evil twins from the outside world (just kidding) etc... It suits the class people as well as the mass.Whereas the classic goatee is often seen in rock stars (people related to music niche), IT guys and a lot of youngsters.\n#2.Stubble\nThis beard style is good particularly for men with bald head (some hair on the sides of the head). The aura of the stubble is sexy.\n#3.Full Beard\nThe full beard is actually a counter to the baldness . Instead of the hair on your head, you grow a beard on the face. The full beard is an excellent choice especially, for those who crossed their 40's. This style may look traditional, but you can customize it to look modern.\nBTW, who else would look great with full beard and bald head, other than our very own Bruce Willis?\n#4.Mustache\nIf you don't like to or not comfortable sporting a beard, then you can try to grow a mustache . The mustache is one of the best options to style with a bald head. Simply, leave your mustache unshaved for 3 or 4 days and it will blend with your face.\nHope these best beard styles for bald man are inspiring.

Fullbeard again, Moustache, Goatee, or something else?\u00a0\nRegards,\nChristian\nAdvertisement\nMore\nI have written a bit about different beard products here:\nHonorary Beard Advocate\nHi Christian,\nYou have a fantastic beard - excellent density/coverage, fullness, shape and colour. You really can wear any style you wish. Your full beard and shaved head is a great look. My own bias would be towards the full beard. If you want to return to the full beard while trying something different, you could experiment with length, shape or moustache size to mix it up. Btw, was that your first full beard?

See dos and don'ts for balding or thinning hair.\nAdd Texture to Thinning Hair\nA textured, short haircut can give the illusion of fullness.\nTaper the sides slightly and style the top with your fingers to create a rough texture that masks thinning hair.\nFaux Hawk\nThe faux hawk, also known as a fohawk, is a style inspired by the mohawk.\nThe faux hawk doesn't involve shaving the sides of the head, but the sides are quite a bit shorter than the top. The longer top locks usually have a lot of texture.\nShaved Head\nA current trend is shaving the head, and the look is so popular that many guys who aren't going bald choose this sleek style.\nThe shaved head isn't for everyone, and it helps to talk to your hair stylist or barber before committing to this style.\nGet Buzzed\nIf shaving seems a little too drastic, you may want to try a buzz.\nThis ultra-short hairstyle for men is typically associated with the military, and it is suitable for any profession.\nFacial Hair\nMany pictures of hairstyles for balding men include facial hair. A neat, short beard or goatee draws the eyes to the face and away from the thinning locks or receding hairline.\nCaesar Cut\nCombing long strands of hair forward isn't usually recommended, but a short cut brushed forward can mask a receding hairline.\nYou can get a refined style with the right haircut.\nThe Comb-over\nNot to be mistaken with the Caesar cut, the comb-over is a masking technique that uses longer strands of hair to cover bald spots.\nApproach this technique with caution because it can have notoriously disastrous results.\nToupee Conundrum\nCan a toup\u00e9e really work for you? Like the combover, this covering technique should be approached with great caution.\nWhat About Plugs?\nThe notion that using the least intrusive method first can apply to a number of things, including hairstyles for balding men.\nPlugs can be expensive, and they can have undignified results.\nTry Natural First\nToup\u00e9es aren't for everyone, and hair plugs can fall short of expectations. Before taking drastic measures, consider going natural. A clean, simple cut can make you look effortlessly dashing.\nBarber's Insight\nGetting a professional opinion can make all the difference. Prepare to discuss different hairstyles for balding men with your barber or hairstylist by looking at photos as inspiration.\nThe hairstyle should accentuate the positive rather than covering thinning or balding areas.\nIt didn't have enough information\nIt had errors or incorrect information\nIt didn't seem trustworthy\n",

Learn hair care, styling tips, and browse pictures gallery of popular hot mens hair styles from short to long, from straight to curly, and from classic to the latest modern hairstyles.\nby Karl\nWhile we live in a world that places a lot of primacy on physical looks where having a crop of abundant hair at the top of your is thought as one of the important expression of masculine style, there are some who have gone against the grain. There is no shortage of bald successful and sexy men who have made it in a variety of fields; from acting to sports and even academia. Here is a brief profile of Top 25 Famous Sexy Bald Men in no particular order.\nMichael Jordan\nWhen it comes to sportsmen, there are a countable few to stand alongside Michael Jordan in terms of how they have influenced men\u2019s style. It is not just Jordan\u2019s line of Nike sports shoes that have become a legacy for the former Chicago Bulls prodigy, his style off the court has mesmerized and awed in equal measure. His dress sense is impeccable and there are few who exude as much machismo whether dressed in a tuxedo or sports kit.\nJason Statham\nAlthough in mid-forties, Jason Stratham soldiers on in his acting career. His talent and incredible screen charm no less captivating as his advancing years or receding hairline would seem to suggest. Besides his acting heroics, few fans know that Jason is also an avid athlete and that he finished twelfth in the 1992 diving world championships.\nVin Diesel\nBorn as Oscar Sinclair Vincent, Vin Diesel is an American actor, director and writer of mixed parentage. Due to his heritage, Vin had early difficulties in finding good roles and today prefers to call himself as \u2018multicultural\u2019. In a television interview, he revealed that he changed his name to Vin Diesel when he worked as a bouncer, a profession he says one should not give out his real name. The Diesel part of his moniker was given to him by his friends who said he must run on diesel because of his boundless energy.\nBruce Willis\nThe German-born American actor known as Bruce Willis is a legend of the big screen whose enduring charm and sex appeal has enthralled generations of cinema lovers for decades today. Bruce Willis is also a singer and has released several albums besides starring in a number of television shows. As a measure of his stature amongst Hollywood legends, the movies he has featured in have grossed well over 3 billion dollars, making him the sixth highest grossing star in a lead role and eighth when supporting roles are brought into reckoning.\nAndre Agassi\nFor years, Andre Agassi held crowds mesmerized with his tennis court heroics. However few tennis enthusiasts know that the prodigy of the clay court wore a wig as he won the 1990 French Open. You have to sympathize with him though considering that at the time he was only twenty at the time. Today, the retired star has come into terms with his hair loss and rarely even spots any facial growth. And his appeal on the social scene has not been any less prodigious for the lack of hair.\nSamuel L Jackson\nSamuel Jackson has risen up in stature both as a cultural icon and screen star since he featured in a series of films in the early nineties. He is also a professional golfer as well as a family man. His success is no less phenomenal as he advances in years and his charm and commanding presence can be expected to offer entertainment and inspiration for cinema goers well into the foreseeable future.\nFrederick \u201cFreddie\u201d Ljungberg\nNobody can question Freddie Ljungberg\u2019s skill with the soccer ball. He made it on to the big stage with his mesmerizing dribbles and runs in opposition defenses. As his hairline receded at the prime of his careers, Ljungberg never shied off and decided to shave it close to his head. He never does cut it of altogether, but retains it close enough. In the twilight years of his career in the Major League Soccer, Ljungberg has continued to be prominent in the social scene and considering the beauties he has continued to attract; his loss of hair has never been an issue for his amazing sexual appeal.\nZinedine Zidane\nHis infamous head but in the final of the 2006 World Cup in Germany has been used on numerous occasions as an unfortunate blemish on an otherwise illustrious career. The achievements of Zinedine Zidane playing either for the top European clubs like Real Madrid and Juventus in the 1990\u2019s and 2000\u2019s. The fact that he showed no less prodigy as his baldness cropped up on his head means that loss of hair should never be an encumbrance to one\u2019s lofty goals. And it in no way lessens a man\u2019s appeal.\nTyson Beckford\nIf there is a man that has come to define the paradigm \u2018less is more\u2019 there is none like Tyson Beckford. The actor cum model has urbane good looks that are not in the least lessened by the fact that he features a clean shaven head. Forget the pronounced tattoos and the rippling abs that are reason enough why Tyson is such a heartthrob. The bald head is a big reason why he is considered such a heartthrob by smitten girls all around the globe.\nTaye Diggs\nEver since he made it on to the global stage with his unforgettable performance in How Stella Got Her Groove Back, Taye Diggs has continued to pull off some amazing stunts of convincing acting. The fact that he sports a shiny head top of the head has not made his performance nor appeal any less intriguing. If anything, his baldness has come to cap off his talent and screen presence. Facial hair aside (of which he has been known to experiment with several styles) Taye\u2019s maintenance free hairstyle is as worth of mention as his disarming smile.\nBen Kingsley\nBen Kingsley is perhaps most well known around the world for his leading role in Richard Attenborough\u2019s movie Gandhi in 1982. For his performance, Kingsley won a slew of awards including the Golden Globe and the Best Actor in the Academy Awards. His performance in portraying Itzhak Stern in the 1993 blockbuster, Schindler\u2019s List proved that this urbane bald headed actor has class about him. He continues to star in a number of films in the twenty first century too and has even been knighted for his endeavors.\nSean Connery\nIt is a fact that sounds like an incredible piece of fiction when fans of James Bond come to know that the first actor to ever bear this iconic moniker wore a toupee to cover his baldness in all his movies. The pioneering agent 007 has achieved what many can only dream of even aspiring to have in a lifetime. Other than a stream of award winning movies that have been the hallmark of his acting career spreading well over three decades, Sean Connery has been knighted by the Queen and has consistently been voted one of the sexiest men alive despite being much older than the prevailing modern sex symbols. His authenticity cannot be questioned though, he has always retained his endearing Scottish accent irrespective of the movie he is featuring in.\nMichael Chiklis\nWith his evocatively rugged looks, Michel Chiklis is one of those television actors whose sexual appeal will continue to enthrall fans for many years to come. Born in 1963, his age and receding hairline have not diminished his commanding screen presence. The quintessential cop in a number of leading drama series has never shied from expressing his revulsion for hair growth adverts. To him it is criminal to treat hair loss as if it was the worst possible happenings that could happen to a man.\nWoody Harrelson\nEven his recent portrayal of Woody Harrelson in the movie The Hunger Games may have brought out a distinctly shaggy haired look, in real life Woody Harrelson spots much less growth on top of his head. This loss of hair has not meant that the veteran actor has any less appeal and charm. It is a safe bet that when the hunkiest rugged men are counted, Woody will be there at the top with the best of them.\nSeal\nWith his unconventional looks and irrepressibly melodic voice have been the hallmarks of the incredibly talented singer known as Seal. Born as Seal Henry Olusegun Olumide Adeola Samuel of Brazilian and Nigerian heritage, he has won just about every award there is to win in showbiz from Brits to Grammies to MTV video awards. Seal has always been a subject of speculation in the media and his enormous sexual appeal is evident from the fact that he has dated the most highly rated actresses including German model Heidi Klum whom he married in 2005 and the couple only came to separate in early 2012.\nLL Cool J\nWhen the history of Rap music is told, there will be a large chapter on LL Cool J. He is credited with the role of moving the genre from the underground to the mainstream of entertainment circles. He has further enhanced his reputation as an actor with a number of global successes like Any Given Sunday. Though he invariably spots trendy head gear, he nonetheless concedes that he spots a balding head.\nPatrick Stewart\nTaking his staid facial appearance and bald head, one would be forgiven for underestimating the talent of Patrick Stewart. However, follicular shortcomings have not derailed the achievements of the star of Star Trek. For over seven years and in 178 episodes of the award winning TV series, Steward went on to achieve phenomenal success with the X-men franchise. His bald head did not stop him from being voted among the 50 most beautiful people in the world by People Magazine in 1995.\nHowie Mandel\nAny list of top 25 famous sexy bald men would be incomplete without mentioning Howie Mandel. He rose to worldwide fame with the phenomenal success of the Deal or No Deal game show but has returned to the television as a judge on America\u2019s Got Talent. Though earlier in his career Mandel used to spot a crop of funky, curly hair he has come to be known for his endearing bald head today. Interestingly enough, Mandel has admitted that he shaved off his hair not because he was balding but because he suffers from mysophobia, a pathological fear of contamination and germs. Apparently, shaving his hair makes him feel cleaner.\nDamon Wayans\nWhen it comes to stand up comedy, there are few who have a natural gift for it to rival the truly prodigious Damon Wayans. His exploits on both the big and small screen are legendary and he is a household name all over the world, at least in homes where laughter is allowed. He is one of the top American sex symbols and his admirers invariably concede that his shiny head is a large part of why they find him irresistible.\nChris Daughtry\nThere has been questions raised in the media and blogosphere whether Chris Daughtry has male pattern baldness or not. However, everyone is in agreement that Chris is one hell of a sexy rock star. Making his mark on the showbiz stage at the American Idols, Chris Daughtry has gone on to achieve success post idols and was even nominated for a Grammy.\nJohn Travolta\nTrendsetter, action hero par excellence, heartthrob, evergreen, suave. All these are tags that immediately spring to mind when one thinks of one of the most enduring stars of Hollywood culture, John Travolta. What many people do not know is that Travolta also spots a much receded hairline than his movies show. He dons one of the most realistic hair pieces and with all that charm, who can question his little vanity?\nTyrese Gibson\nStill in his youthful thirties, Tyrese Gibson spots closely shaved hair that all the same has not diminished his sex appeal. When you consider that he is a rapper, R n B, singer, songwriter, actor and model, you have to wonder if it is possible for someone to have more going for them. Tyrese is certainly going places and with his hairstyle, he has scored a big point in a bid to cultivate a self-made image.\nYul Brynner\nThere are fewer enduring sex symbols of the showbiz industry to equal the magnetism and allure of Yul Brynner. The Russian stage and film actor is best known for his role as Mongkut in The King and I as well as Rameses in the 1956 epic, The Ten Commandments. Many years since he died he is still remembered for being one of the stars who have shown that sexy and hair loss are not necessarily mutually exclusive.\nMontel Williams\nAs an actor, radio show host and television personality, Montel Williams has enduring appeal for millions of American fans and many more around the world. His own Montel William Show has earned following among enthusiastic television audiences for close to two decades. He has also written a number of books.\nAvery Brooks\nTalented, sexy and as photogenic as they come; Avery Brooks has that capacity to draw attention on stage, screen or in printed media. He has won Awards in television, cinema, documentaries and theater. Brooks has also been a teacher and has made notable contributions in promotion of African American cultural heritage.\nRelated Posts:\nComment\nName *\nEmail *\nWebsite\nRecent Posts\n",

If you are losing your hair not so fast, then you can style it, so that no one sees the problem. The best tips so far can be seen in Jude Law's styling.\nYou can style your hair to look messy, or a bit wet. The important thing is to make it look voluminous, but you can always make an ultra short hair. Here below are shown some ideas and tips of Law's hair styling. By the way, I recommend to take a closer look at Jude's everyday outfits styling, it's very elegant and casual. Love the way he mixes elegant details with everyday staples.\nIf it happens, that you are starting to lose your hair faster than you were expected, then the first thing you have to do is to accept it and look at things differently. Of course, if it happened so, that you've been a star and dreamboat boy for many girls, then I can understand your hard feelings, but, listen, you are a man and you have to face the fact that you are going to be bald. It's officially now, you can call Sean Connery, Zinedine Zidane, Heston Blumenthal, Jude Law and Larry David comrades.\nHere below are shown inspirational images of how to make a right haircut:\nIf you don't want to shave your head, then always pay attention to your side hair, DO NOT make it long:\nOnce you have decided to go fully bald, then style your head with care. It's better to look a bit bronzed and always take care of your hair length, as soon as it starts to grow make sure you are shaving it by time.\nSome guys and men start to grow a beard, as it looks masculine and keeps eyes away from bald look. Here are some images for your inspiration:\nHere are showcased style tips and clothing ideas for bald men. As you can see, the style of dressing can be different, but most of time, when men become bald they try to look more elegant and masculine. Some try to look a bit militaristic, wearing khaki style outfits. Here are my two favorite inspo style images:\nAaron Field\nHair or no hair- As long as you\u2019ve got the confidence you can pull any style off\nThe Art of Shaving\nIt does look nice to have a beard if you shave your head. If not a beard, then at least some facial hair like a goatee or mustache. It makes a man look even more manly.\nManoj vohra\nBald  :it depends  on face cuts  height  and health  it\u2019s  cannot suits on everyone\nI enjoyed your  blog very much; you  provided interesting observations, helpful tips, and excellent photos.\nHowever, the grammar and composition need attention, especially, your, inappropriate, use, of, the, comma.\nJake\nYou people need to lay off him! I\u2019m sorry, but CHRIST!! We all get the point, or else nobody knows what to correct on.\nLeo, keep it up. I follow it. \uf609\nA gent\nHey Leo and guys and gals!  Blogs (or posts on places like pintrest) devoted to helping people with their fashion choices are super handy.  Thanks for posting Leo.\nI don\u2019t maintain a blog, so I will share my thoughts here just for kicks and giggles.\nAs a balding guy, I\u2019ve found that dressing up is much preferable to dressing down.  As was mentioned in this article, short hair seems to work much better for balding guys.  I prefer to keep mine in the 1.5-2mm range.  Never, under any circumstances, allow the side to get longer than the top by any significant amount.  In my case this means quite a bit of maintenance.  It is, however, worth the effort because *no one likes wings on the side and polished up top.  (*maybe clowns? but we all know they\u2019re creepy)\nSeveral things I\u2019ve picked up over the last while that don\u2019t seem like that big of a deal are: learn what ties are good for what knots and pair them with the correct shirts/jackets, learn how to roll your sleeves (it honestly looks better the right way), color coordinate you shoes, watch, and belt, wear pants that fit (not too tight, not too baggy), shave (or at least maintain your scruff/beard), and last, but certainly not least, learn to be confident!  Confidence is not so much related to what you\u2019re wearing, or even your features, it is all about what is on the inside.  I know tons of \u201cnontraditional\u201d body type folks (aka normal people) that look fantastic.  It\u2019s all about being comfortable in your own skin and having a good attitude.  You could be a model for Abercrombie, but if you\u2019re a jerk\u2026it\u2019s going to be a pretty hollow existence.  Don\u2019t try to be someone else.  While I readily admit that fashion can be somewhat vain and copycat-y (I know that\u2019s not a word), there\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t work with what we\u2019ve got!  I\u2019ve got tree trunks for thighs and a decent size kiester, but darn if I\u2019m going to let that stop me from wearing a nice suit.  Tailoring and alteration businesses exist for a reason.\nAll in all I just urge all of you to love the skin you\u2019re in and treat it accordingly.\nP.S.  Get a massage, they\u2019re awesome.\nRegards, a gent.\nP.P.S  I\u2019m not an author, so I am not entirely clear on the proper use of parentheses.  I most likely overuse them, but hey, if you understand my point the battle has been won.\nchad\nwhat hairstyle recommendation for a man with a growing bald spot, not a receding hairline? I don\u2019t really think I have the right head shape to look good shaved.\nNed's Head\nTo Chad: Rogaine is specifically targeted to men like you \u2013 people who have hair loss on the crown. It\u2019s worth it to give it a shot and the sooner you start the better your chances of retaining what you have there and improving growth possibilities. I\u2019ve used Rogaine for about 8 months and while my hair is still thin on the crown it\u2019s not as thin as it was and it has filled in some. So as long as you aren\u2019t in a hurry and you don\u2019t mind daily applications then you might give it a shot. Rogaine isn\u2019t perfect but it\u2019s a reasonable approach until they figure something else out.\nAnd I Am 20 Years Old\nNaman,\nI shaved my head when I was 22 so I know the feeling. I honestly that a shaved head on a younger guy gives an edge because you still will have that youthful look but it will be contrasted by the shaved head. I pretty much always keep stubble and I wear glasses as well, I believe they help.\nMaybe consider some lifestyle changes as well. I think bald looks better on a man who is lower body fat, so take a look at your diet, exercise and sleep schedules.\nI hope I\u2019ve helped you\nThey all have one thing in common though. They have beautiful faces. So it doesn\u2019t really matter much what kind of hair they have. They can have long, short, be bald or whatever, they will still be hot. What about the guys who do not have attractive facial features or bonestructures in the face? (who prior to being bald made up for it with hairstyles) They look like fucking assholes\u2026 I\u2019m one of them, and I\u2019m bald\u2026 It\u2019s killing me, I just want to eat a bullet\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\ntyler delgregg\nMy hair has become loose over the years; I have suffered the loss of my loose hair every week. Alas, I lost  more each month.  Thus, I have shaved my head and grown a beard, my loose hair  has fallen, lost forever, but whence did my lost hair gone?  Oh yes, the lose part\u2026.when you lose your loose hair, consider in lost.\nvimal raj\nI am bald head man my age 31 but I am different stylish man.i love my  style\nRichie\nA Gent: It was really nice of you to put down your thoughts here. You should definitely start blogging. Thanks for giving a balding guy a good boost.\nLeave a Reply\nComment\nName *\nEmail *\nRecent Comments\n",

            "81": "Generally, it is a norm for people to think that beard is only for those with a good looking hairstyle. But, like everything in this world, fashion trends too change with time. And Yes! Men with bald head too look good by sporting a beard or facial hairstyle that match their facial structure. Basically, there are two types of bald heads - permanent bald head and clean shaved head.\nIn the first type i.e., permanent bald head, there will be some hair on the sides of the head, whereas in the second type, it is completely hairless (those who choose to shave off a full head of hair).\nSo, it is very important to grow a beard style that balances your face shape and size so that you could attract the eyeballs towards your beard easily. You can give your personality an extra mile by sporting a cool beard style with the perfect dressing.\nDifferent Types of Beard Styles for Bald Heads\nYou can sport any of the below facial hairstyles for a trendy look. They are\nGoatee (Full or Classic)\n#1.Goatee\nHugh Jackman, who is popularly known for his role as a Wolverine in the X-Men series has got a completely new avatar (Blackbeard) for his role in the upcoming movie 'Pan'. He is sporting a beard style called 'Goatee' with twirled mustache and a shaved head. This facial hairstyle is also known as Van Dyke.\nThere are various styles of Goatee but everything falls under two categories - full goatee and classic goatee.\nThe full goatee is often seen in bikers, corporate people, construction men, evil twins from the outside world (just kidding) etc... It suits the class people as well as the mass.Whereas the classic goatee is often seen in rock stars (people related to music niche), IT guys and a lot of youngsters.\n#2.Stubble\nThis beard style is good particularly for men with bald head (some hair on the sides of the head). The aura of the stubble is sexy.\n#3.Full Beard\nThe full beard is actually a counter to the baldness . Instead of the hair on your head, you grow a beard on the face. The full beard is an excellent choice especially, for those who crossed their 40's. This style may look traditional, but you can customize it to look modern.\nBTW, who else would look great with full beard and bald head, other than our very own Bruce Willis?\n#4.Mustache\nIf you don't like to or not comfortable sporting a beard, then you can try to grow a mustache . The mustache is one of the best options to style with a bald head. Simply, leave your mustache unshaved for 3 or 4 days and it will blend with your face.\nHope these best beard styles for bald man are inspiring.

Learn More\nBy Steven Richmond \u2022Oct 9th, 2015 Blog / Lifestyle\nHalloween isn\u2019t the only holiday in October \u2013 today is Bald and Free Day , a time to celebrate chrome domes everywhere.\nThere are many perks to not having hair: you save money on hair care products, you never have to worry about hat hair and you\u2019re naturally more aerodynamic.\nBut if you\u2019re new to being bald, or you\u2019re caring for a senior with full-blown baldness, you might not know the best techniques to care for an exposed scalp and look good in the process.\nCheck out these seven tips for looking flawless when you\u2019re hairless.\n1. Commit to the bald look\nHow do you it\u2019s time to shave it all off? According to hair re-growth specialist Dr. Alex Khadavi , there are a few signs to indicate you\u2019re on the road to male pattern baldness.\n\u201cNormally we shed 50-100 hairs a day, most people don\u2019t become alarmed to that until they start noticing their scalp more or recession in widow\u2019s peak,\u201d Khadavi said.\nYou don\u2019t want to be that guy trying to keep up appearances with thinning hair. Combovers, toup\u00e9es and that bowl cut monks use are never going to come back in style.\nIf your hairline hasn\u2019t receded entirely to the back of your head, you could spend some time with a close buzz cut as a way to dip your toes into the pool of baldness. But it may be advantageous to commit to a close shave to the sides or a completely barren look.\n\u201cDo what matches your head and proportionalize your face to your hair,\u201d Khadavi said.\nBut whatever you choose, do so with conviction and stick with it.\n2. Understand your head before you shave it\nYou don\u2019t need to be an expert in phrenology (the study of cranial contours), but it would behoove you to take time to understand the scalp you\u2019re shaving before you whip out the clippers.\nWhy is this important? It\u2019s very easy to knick, cut, scrape or otherwise damage scalp if it\u2019s your first time shaving off a head full of hair. This is doubly true if you or the senior you\u2019re caring for has Parkinsons ( luckily HomeHero has plenty of qualified caregivers ready to help ).\nTake time to find any scars, moles and other protruding features before shaving off hair. Damaging your scalp could leave unsightly scars.\n3. Prepare the hair (or beware)\nShaving your hair on your head isn\u2019t unlike shaving the hair on your face. Be sure to follow all the typical pre-shaving rituals you normally would.\nThis includes: *Washing the hair with warm water; *Applying your favorite shave cream or oil; *Removing the bulk of the hair with electric clippers.\n4. Using clippers and razors\nIf you\u2019re going beyond the short buzz cut and removing hair entirely, be sure to use a sharp, new razor to remove the remaining stubble. It should go without saying, but when it\u2019s time to cut, remember to cut along the grain of the hair. This means moving from top to bottom, following the natural direction of the hair.\nGoing against the grain can pull hair in unnatural directions and can actually rip it right out of the scalp. You might be going bald, but you don\u2019t want to irritate the skin around existing hair follicles.\nIf the head in question has much thicker or longer hair on the sides than is suitable for a razor, use a set of electric clippers to remove a bulk of the hair first before whipping out the razors.\nRemember to take your time and to not rush the shaving process. If you\u2019re shaving someone else, remember to place your hand gently on the top of their head for stability.\nPeople tend to unknowingly crane or bend their necks while receiving haircuts. This is important to keep in mind with seniors who might have arthritis or chronic neck pain.\n5. Frame your new look\nA finely-tuned bald look has an interesting habit of accentuating your other features. Without hair, the color of your eyes, the shape of your head and the features of your face all become more prominent.\nExperiment with new clothing options you might not have considered before. Hats, turtlenecks, collars, scarves, glasses and jewelry (such as earrings and necklaces) can bring a hairless look together in interesting ways.\n6. Rock the beard\nTry going for an inverted look where a majority of your hair is along the jawline as opposed to above the eye-line. Stubble, goatees, soul patches and full-on lumberjack beards are all excellent options for the bald gentleman.\nLook to men such as Ben Bernanke, Bruce Willis, Sean Connery, Will Smith and Bryan Cranston for examples of successful combinations of cue balls with facial hair.\nThe \u201c Bald & Bearded \u201d Tumblr can give you some inspiration for your next look.\n7. Take care of your scalp\nCaring for a bald scalp is actually pretty simple, Khadavi says.\n\u201cAs long as you don\u2019t have dermatitis or dandruff, you can use plain old soap,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can also use anti-dandruff shampoo to control irritation on the scalp.\u201d\nAs you would with the rest of your body, clean your bald head regularly to keep it looking neat and fresh.\nAlso remember that your head will now be exposed to more direct sunlight. Be sure to apply sunscreen if you expect to be in direct sunlight for more than a few minutes.\nHave any other tips for looking good with little-to-no hair?

That is why we have seen a 25% increase in men seeking hair transplants in the last two years.\n'Men no longer have to put up with being bald, particularly as medical science improves and transplants leave men looking so much better.'\u00a0\nREVOLUTIONARY TREATMENT SEES INTRODUCTION OF THE BEARD TRANSPLANT IN THE UK\nDr Shahmalak has pioneered the introduction of beard and sideburn transplants in the UK.\nThese before and after pictures show a patient who had naturally thin sideburns and had a sideburn transplant at Crown Clinic to make them bushier.\nDr Shahmalak says that since the treatment the client has felt completely reinvented.\u00a0\n'He was a farmer and he craved a bushier brow to make him seem more manly. He was delighted with the results.'\nCrown Clinic is Britain's most popular celebrity transplant clinic.Dr Shahamalak has carried out hair transplants on a number of celebrities including the model Calum Best and Christian Jessen, presenter of the Channel 4 medical show Embarrassing Bodies.\u00a0\nShare or comment on this article\nMost watched News videos\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\nMore top stories\nDON'T MISS\n'Couldn't ask for a better present': Birthday girl Binky Felstead shares first glimpse of her baby daughter as she brings her home from the hospital\n'It makes you creative' Tamara Ecclestone discusses sharing her marital bed with daughter Sophia, three... as she vows to continue breastfeeding\n'I'm embracing my body and its changes': Ashley James poses in her lingerie for sizzling snap as she reveals her favourite part of her figure is her 'thigh creases'\nOlivia Newton-John's daughter Chloe Lattanzi criticised as 'unhealthy' after sharing a photo of herself looking VERY slender in a crop top Posed with a cigarette\n'You're too skinny': Megan McKenna sparks concern as she bares 'visible ribs' in bikini snap... yet devoted defenders BLAST critics for body shaming'\nShish kebab, chicken bravas with garlic aioli and calamari with seasoned rice: Why eating healthily this summer just got a WHOLE lot more fun\u00a0 SPONSORED\n'I couldn't be happier for them': Made in Chelsea's Ollie Locke swoons over new parents Binky Felstead and Josh Patterson in heartfelt Instagram post\n'The love I have for her is unconditional': Amy Childs posts sweet snap cradling daughter Polly... after confirming shock split from boyfriend Bradley Wright\n'I'd snog him': BB's Marnie Simpson admits to having the hots for Kieran Lee... as she blasts Kayleigh Morris in brutal Diary Room chat\nDemi Rose Mawby exhibits her eye-popping cleavage and voluptuous derriere in sexy snaps from idyllic Greek getaway Tyga's rumoured ex\u00a0\nFrom Hollyoaks to Hollywood!

            "96": "Stay Sexy: The Best Black Men Beard Styles of 2016\nAll You Need to Know About Beard Styles for Black Men\nFor black men (and men of all races), having a beard or other facial hair style can add some much needed style to your look. Not only that, but beards also simply exude masculinity and are probably one of the sexiest fashion accessories you\u2019ll find. There is no doubting that beards are definitely \u201cin\u201d right now, but deciding which style suits you best comes down to the shape of your face and the look you\u2019re going for.\nThere are plenty of beard styles for black men that are popular at the moment, but not all styles look great on every man. Therefore, to help you out in your search for the ultimate bearded look, we\u2019ll use this article to discuss the best beard styles for black men and what it takes to achieve them.\nThe Best Black Men Beard Styles of 2016\n#1 Goatee, Circle Beard & Van Dyke\nProbably one of the most timeless and classic beard styles for black men, the goatee and its various incarnations have the ability to help shape the face and accentuate your best features. All three of these popular goatee styles help draw attention and focus to the mouth, which can act as a subtle hint to remind others of your sexiness.\nAlthough we\u2019ve previously covered the differences between the various goatee styles, we\u2019ll repeat them here just so you\u2019re in the know. Basically, a true goatee consists only of hair directly on the chin, whereas a Van Dyke is more of a separate mustache and true goatee combination (where the two are not connected). Finally, a circle beard combines both the goatee and mustache in a full circle (or square) of hair that surrounds the entire mouth. All three of these are popular beard styles for black men, being worn by celebrities such as Kanye West (circle beard), P. Diddy (usually a Van Dyke, but sometimes a circle beard) and Ludacris (Van Dyke).\nThe good thing about all of these styles is that they tend to require less maintenance than many others, as most goatee styles can still look slick even with a bit of stubble on the cheeks. Choosing between the three is really a matter of how your facial hair grows and what you think looks best, so don\u2019t be afraid to experiment, as there are a ton of excellent goatee styles that look fantastic on African American men.\n#2 Chin Strap\nThis is another one of the more popular black men beard styles, but also one that\u2019s a bit harder to pull off, as it requires more constant maintenance and upkeep to stay stylish. In recent times, this style has been popularized by a number of black and Latino baseball stars, including David Ortiz and Melky Cabrera (who both sport a wide chinstrap).\nIn simple terms, the chinstrap beard is exactly what it sounds like, a strap of hair that runs along the chin from ear to ear. However, when it comes to wearing the chin strap , you\u2019ve got quite a few choices, depending on how thick or thin you want the strap to be. While many black men prefer the wider chin strap (which could basically be described as a full beard minus the mustache), many others prefer the look of a pencil thin chin strap. Either way, if you\u2019re willing to do the work to keep your cheeks and neck free from stubble, you can be rewarded with a style that screams manliness. In truth, that\u2019s really the only issue with this style, as it requires almost daily trimming and shaving to keep it looking its best.\nWhile a true chin strap only includes hair along the jawline (read: no mustache), there are also a huge number of famous black men sporting a thin chin strap and circle beard combination, such as Ice Cube or 50 Cent, while LeBron James and others often go for the chinstrap and mustache combo (where the two are not connected, as in the Van Dyke).\n#3 Soul Patch & Chin Strip\nThe soul patch is another popular facial hair style for black men and one that looks excellent alongside a shaved head. This is probably about as minimal as you can get with facial hair, as the true soul patch refers only to the small patch of hair directly below the bottom lip. Another popular variation is the chin strip (not to be confused with the chin strap), which is basically an elongated soul patch that extends down to the bottom of the chin.\nIn truth, the soul patch is probably one of the harder styles to pull off, as it\u2019s definitely not something that looks good on all men. Therefore, if you\u2019re considering this style, you may want to think about pairing it with a mustache, as this helps to make the soul patch not stand out so much. Not only that, but mustaches typically look great on a huge range of black men and are always a popular choice.\n#4 Five O\u2019 Clock Shadow & Stubble\nProbably the easiest (although some would say laziest) of all black men beard styles is the five \u2018o clock shadow or permanent stubble. Men like John Legend have perfected the art of the five o\u2019 clock shadow, which is carefully crafted to make it look like you\u2019re always slightly in need of a shave, which makes plenty of people think that you\u2019re so manly that you simply can never keep your face clean shaven.\nThis style is a great choice for those who can\u2019t or are unwilling to grow a full beard, especially the former, as the overall stubble helps to hide any patches where your hair might not grow in fully. Either the five o\u2019 clock shadow or permanent stubble require fairly constant trimming, but the good thing about them is that you can simply put the guard on your beard trimmer and go to town, unlike goatees or other styles that require more careful trimming to stay looking their best.\nTo achieve the five o\u2019 clock shadow look, we recommend going for three or four days without shaving. Then, all you\u2019ll need to do is grab your trimmer and the shortest guard and use it to go over the entire face every day or two. The permanent stubble look is basically the exact same thing, except the hairs are generally kept slightly longer, which is why this style only needs to be trimmed every two to four days (depending on how fast your facial hair grows).\n#5 Full Beard\nThere was a long time when only a small percentage of black men ever went with the full beard. However, this is one style that has really started to grow in popularity in more recent times, with men like Rick Ross and Questlove often seen sporting rugged full beards. Still, this is another one of those styles that\u2019s not always so easy to pull off, as it takes a man with the right shape of face and the right facial hair to do it.\nTypically we would recommend this style for men who either have stronger facial features or a rounder face, but the biggest factor is whether or not your facial hair grows in thick and full enough to actually achieve a full beard. If it does, then why not give up shaving for a few weeks and see what it looks like. After all, you can always trim it down to any of the other styles on this list if you\u2019re not happy with the look. You may also decide you want to go with something more along the lines of the chinstrap and mustache or chinstrap and circle beard combination, but the only way to know is to let it grow.\nStill, if you do decide to go with the full beard, it\u2019s important to invest in a high quality beard trimmer, as you\u2019ll probably want to fade the sides and under the jawline, or else you risk looking like you just don\u2019t give a damn. The key to the full beard is to learn exactly how to keep it trimmed so that it continues to look rugged and manly, without making you look like a lazy slob. Fore more details on whether this is the beard for you and how to maintain it check out this article .\nImportant Info For All Beard Styles\nNo matter what style of beard you decide to go with proper shaving and trimming is essential to making it look good. There are some essential how tos including how to shave your cheek line and neck line with a beard as well as the necessary products including picking up one of the best beard trimmers , a premium beard oil or the perfect beard balm ,\u00a0and a quality safety razor or\u00a0if you can\u2019t handle the safety razor, at least on of the best disposable razors .\nAt the end of the day, there are a huge number of black men beard styles that can look excellent, so in truth, our list is probably only the tip of the iceberg. You can find tons of pictures of beard styles for black men online (including the excellent Black & Bearded Tumblr exploring the beauty of black beards), but whatever style you choose, it\u2019s important you put in the work to keep it trimmed so you stay stylish.\nHey!

I\u2019ve try one or two but they have harmful chemicals in them that seem to burn my face. Are there any out there that will give me that black hair that I\u2019m looking for without having to want to jump in a pool of cold water because my face is on fire. Thanks.\nBen Rose on December 3, 2015 at 3:11 pm\nGreat question Bernard. I have to be honest and say I am not familiar with the hair dye creams. I think this is a very important topic though and I will be sure to put it on our list of products to test/research. Until then, best of luck!\nComment\nName *\nEmail *\nWebsite\nShare This\nMake sure to confirm your email to enter to win!\u00a0\nSUBSCRIBE!\n",

Prince William with and without his beard\nWhen other men were asked their opinion, they said that men pictured looked older and angrier when bearded.\nHowever,  both sexes said that facial hair added gravitas, with bearded men  perceived to have a higher social status and command more respect from  other men.\nThe results suggest that beards send a signal of masculinity to other men but do little to attract women.\nResearcher  Paul Vasey, of the University of Lethbridge in Canada, who has sported a  goatee for more than 20 years, said the findings were made more sound  by the inclusion of men from different cultures.\nBefore and after: Keanu Reeves hirsute and shaven\nWhile the women from New Zealand may have been swayed by the current fashion in western films and media for clean-shaven faces, magazines, billboards and cinemas are few and far between in Samoa.\nEven internet access is relatively sparse.\nNick Neave, a Northumbria University psychologist, who never goes past the \u2018heavy stubble\u2019 stage, said: \u2018We are often of the assumption that male characteristics are to do with females and females choosing them.\n\u2018The other way of looking at it is that males\u2019 faces and bodies are probably mostly designed to fend off other males and what females like is neither here nor there.\u2019\nDr Neave\u2019s own research in the topic found light stubble to get the highest ratings from women.\n\u00a0\nMost watched News videos\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\nBing\nSite\nWeb\nDON'T MISS\n'Couldn't ask for a better present': Birthday girl Binky Felstead shares first glimpse of her baby daughter as she brings her home from the hospital\n'It makes you creative' Tamara Ecclestone discusses sharing her marital bed with daughter Sophia, three... as she vows to continue breastfeeding\n'I'm embracing my body and its changes': Ashley James poses in her lingerie for sizzling snap as she reveals her favourite part of her figure is her 'thigh creases'\nOlivia Newton-John's daughter Chloe Lattanzi criticised as 'unhealthy' after sharing a photo of herself looking VERY slender in a crop top Posed with a cigarette\n'You're too skinny': Megan McKenna sparks concern as she bares 'visible ribs' in bikini snap... yet devoted defenders BLAST critics for body shaming'\nShish kebab, chicken bravas with garlic aioli and calamari with seasoned rice: Why eating healthily this summer just got a WHOLE lot more fun\u00a0 SPONSORED\n'I couldn't be happier for them': Made in Chelsea's Ollie Locke swoons over new parents Binky Felstead and Josh Patterson in heartfelt Instagram post\n'The love I have for her is unconditional': Amy Childs posts sweet snap cradling daughter Polly... after confirming shock split from boyfriend Bradley Wright\n'I'd snog him': BB's Marnie Simpson admits to having the hots for Kieran Lee... as she blasts Kayleigh Morris in brutal Diary Room chat\nDemi Rose Mawby exhibits her eye-popping cleavage and voluptuous derriere in sexy snaps from idyllic Greek getaway Tyga's rumoured ex\u00a0\nMake-up free Sam Faiers keeps it casual in black leisurewear as she runs errands with beau Paul Knightley in Essex\u00a0 Au natural\nMelanie Sykes, 46, exposes serious cleavage as she shows off her gym-honed physique in sizzling bikini snap Tanned and toned\nFrom Hollyoaks to Hollywood!

            "6": "\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHere you can find a selection of popular Beard Styles where you can find information on how to grow your very own. You can find out what styles celebrities are choosing, where each style originated, what age groups each beard style attracts and of course how to achieve the look you want. There are plenty more beard styles out the to choose but these are our favourite and most popular.\nShort Boxed Beard-\u00a0One of the most popular beards and probably the first beard any man will grow, the short boxed beard has minimal maintenance for a stylish look. It is the perfect road to take if you don\u2019t want it as short as the 5 o\u2019clock shadow but not as long as full on beast mode.\u00a0You can practice cutting in the neckline and cheeks before taking on\u00a0anything more adventurous.\u00a0Another great reason why the Short Boxed Beard is popular is because it relies on your beard\u2019s natural shape and it can complement any face, so no matter what shape or size the beard will suit\u00a0you which is of great importance. It is entirely up to you how long you grow your beard but this versatile style looks great as stubble, medium\u00a0and long length.\nHollywoodian- A\u00a0beard with integrated mustache that is worn on the lower part of the chin and jaw area, without connecting sideburns (Wikipedia).\u00a0The Hollywoodian beard style is similar to a Short Boxed Beard only that the beard and sideburns are not connected and the facial hair\u00a0at the jaw line is longer. Some people say it is just an extended goatee giving your face a broader look. It was a very popular beard back in the day with Hollywood move stars hence the name. Most recently\u00a0you could have seen Zac Efron and Mark Pellegrino sporting this beard showing that it suits any age group making this particular beard just as\u00a0versatile as the Short Boxed Beard. Please note this isn\u2019t a beard just for famous people, it is for you as well!\nGoatee-\u00a0The term goatee was used to describe\u00a0a tuft of hair on the chin as that on the chin of a goat. There is a similarity with a Goatee and our next style Van Dyke but to me personally I see a goatee as to being a lot shorter than a Van Dyke, and also a goatee doesn\u2019t include a mustache, not that you can\u2019t have one, we are just being politically correct for a second\u2026. moving on! This beard style was very popular in the 90\u2019s, wrestling fans will remember Stone Cold Steve Austin rocking a Goatee in the WWF as it was known back then. That doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t popular now, you can find recent pictures of celebrities like Brad Pitt, Ben Affleck and Colin Farrell sporting this timeless piece, showing the Goatee still has a place.\nVan Dyke-\u00a0All though our picture shows the Van Dyke style beard to be basically a Goatee but bigger and with a mustache, the Van Dyke is usually a more pointed goatee. You can start this style from day one stubble shaving the cheeks\u00a0leaving your chin whiskers and mustache intact.\u00a0As your chin Goatee grows longer, you need to use your beard trimmer\u00a0to carefully trim it into a pointed shape. This is not easy so make sure you take your time and do not trim too much off, if you do you can use style wax or beard oil to shape the tip to hide any minor mistake. The most popular celebrities who sport this style regularly is Johnny Depp and Micky Rourke, personally I would say it suits men over 40 but I am sure some people could prove us wrong!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMutton Chops-\u00a0Are patches of facial hair that extend from the hairline to below the ears but stop before the chin. Mutton Chops also known as sideburns get their name from a 19th century United States Senator called Ambrose Burnside.\u00a0His distinctive style of facial hair\u00a0became known as sideburns,\u00a0derived from his last name. The most iconic person to \u2018ROCK\u2019 Mutton Chops was the one and only Elvis Presley so they must be cool! All though not as popular as other beard styles, Mutton Chops\u00a0remain a popular and dramatic style. You would be making some statement if you were to grow these sideburns, but make sure you keep them trimmed to avoid an untidy look.\nThe Zappa-\u00a0Originated with 1940\u2019s born musician Frank Zappa is a thick mustache with a large square off soul patch. This style is popular with\u00a0bikers and rockers and Motley Crue star Tommy Lee can often be seen rocking out with this style. This is one cool beard and pulled off right, this style can really rock for you! For a good-looking Zappa trim your beard to around 3-5mm, trim the outline of your mustache\u00a0so that it extends down towards your chin by about 5cm\u00a0and is\u00a0about 2.5cm wide. We suggest leaving a 2cm gap between your Soul Patch and mustache making the width of the soul patch 3-5cm and 2-3cm in length.\u00a0A Zappa is nice and full, so really let the style grow in don\u2019t be afraid to try different lengths to what we suggest.\n\u00a0\nBalbo-\u00a0Originates from Italian fascist Italo Balbo who was born in 1896 and is one cool beard! Nothing shows how\u00a0bold, stylish and self-confident you are like the Balbo. This beard style is made up of three-parts, including a mustache, soul patch, and a beard that stops before it reaches your sideburns. When Ironman and Batman are rocking this on a regular basis then you know it\u2019s cool! Robert Downey Jr and Christian Bale have been sporting this look for numerous years and it isn\u2019t going away any time soon. To achieve this greatness simply shape a 2-3cm soul patch creating an upside down letter \u2018T\u2019 curving outwards. Then depending on desired length or how wide you chin is you should aim for a beard around 6-8cm wide. Shaving the side burns, neckline and cheeks will give a more prominent look.\n\u00a0\n",

            "8": "Today\u2019s Hottest Beard Styles\nBeards have reached new heights of popularity in the 2010s and there are countless beard styles men are wearing now. It is estimated that more than half of the world\u2019s adult male population has one, and the fastest growing demographic to embrace the beard is the 20-something crowd. And why wouldn\u2019t they? After all, the beard is the ultimate symbol of manliness. That is, as long as it isn\u2019t left to simply grow wild and free. A little bit of style goes a long way when it comes to beard grooming, and finding the perfect style to fit your face shape, personality and lifestyle will definitely turn all heads in your direction.\nThe differences in some beard styles is subtle; others are very distinctive. Understated, classical, contemporary, mountain-man or bold-and-edgy\u2026 it doesn\u2019t matter what effect you\u2019re looking for, there is a style that suits every face shape and taste. Let\u2019s start with a basic description of beard types and then move on to specific beard styles.\nPartial Beards\nThe term \u201c partial beard \u201d is loosely-defined, but basically refers to any facial hair growth (including the mustache) that covers part, but not all, of the skin under the lower lip, lower jaw and the area above it to approximately the cheekbone. A partial beard may or may not extend all the way to the ear area, may or may not include a mustache, and may be any length from stubble to long and beyond.\nFull Beards\nA full beard usually refers to any style/shape where the hair is left to grow and cover most or all of the space under the chin. It extends all the way to the ears on both sides of the face, and covers the face from the jawline or below all the way up to the cheekbone area. A full beard can be very short, even just a couple of days\u2019 stubble, to long and beyond. A full beard typically includes a mustache, which usually joins up with the beard hair.\nAs you can see from these explanations, hair length does not matter as much as square inches when defining a \u201cpartial\u201d versus a \u201cfull\u201d beard. The beard styles we will outline here are either partial or full, but many of them can be worn short or long or somewhere in between. \u201cStyle\u201d in many cases refers to the shape of the cut, not necessarily the length of the hair.\nThere are many beard styles and mustache styles in the world today. Below you will find 37 of the best beard styles for men.\nBeard Styles: Mustaches/Partial Beards\n1) Pencil Mustache\n\u00a0\n2) Dali Style\nThis mustache resembles a very long version of the pencil. The ends are typically twisted tightly as far toward the center of the mustache as possible.\n3) Copstash Standard Mustache Style\nThe stereotypical style for the 1970s cop, the copstash is slightly wider than the pencil, with ends that extend no further than just past the outer edges of the nose.\n4) Handlebar Mustache Style\nIn this style, the mustache hairs are left to grow longer, so that the ends extend to the lines of the eyes or even slightly beyond. The ends are then twisted into a point.\n5) Super Mario Mustache Style\nThis one is for the avid gamer or the guy who dares to be flashy. Just think Super Mario from the Nintendo series. This style is wide, thick and long, sort of an upside-down handlebar mustache without the twisted ends.\n6) Mighty El Insecto Beard Style\nThis unique and daring minimalist style features a thin, curved \u201cC\u201d shape of hair on either side of the lower chin and downward, like insect jaws.\n7) Soul Patch\nThis beard is the smallest patch of hair that can still be called a beard. Almost all facial hair is shaved, except for a small patch of hair just under the lower lip. A soul patch can be worn with or without a mustache.\n8) Zappa\nPopularized by American rock musician and guitarist Frank Zappa, this style features a box-shaped soul patch and wide, bushy mustache with ends turned downward at about the mid-eye line.\n9) Imperial/Napoleon the III Imperial\nThis style requires merely growing the soul patch a little bit longer, so that it extends to the bottom of the chin or slightly beyond, keeping the shape of the lines rounded and tidy. The Imperial can be worn with or without a mustache. The Napoleon the III Imperial is a slightly different take on the Imperial, with the chin hair extending further past the lower chin to form a long soul patch.\n10) A la Souvarov\nBarely a beard, this style features a mustache, the ends of which extend all the way to the ear line or hairline. The lines are typically curved and rounded.\n11) Franz Josef\nSimilar to the A la Souvarov, but less flashy. Lines are straight and crisp and form the shape of a \u201cW.\u201d\n12) Fu Manchu\nThis is another style that straddles the line between \u201cmustache\u201d and \u201cbeard.\u201d The mustache hairs are trimmed to form a very narrow, fairly straight line which turns downward in right angles at the ends. The beard part of the style extends downward to just past the lower part of the chin.\n13) Winnefield\nThis style looks like a cross between a Fu Manchu and a Franz Josef, except the sideburns are cut off from (not connected to) the Fu Manchu part of the style.\n14) Rap Industry Standard\nSimilar to the Fu Manchu, but even narrower. Its lines are slightly more rounded, and it typically includes a close and similarly narrow-shaven \u201cbeard\u201d which extends the length of the lower jaw line to the ear. As its name implies, it is popular with rap artists.\n15) Anchor\nThis style is so-named because the hair is shaved and trimmed into an anchor shape around the mouth/chin. The mustache forms the anchor\u2019s crossbar/stock. The soul patch forms the anchor\u2019s stock, and the hair is shaved down to the lower part of the chin and rounded off, forming the anchor\u2019s crown. The hairline moves outward to just past the ends of the mouth and shaved to points, forming the anchor\u2019s flukes.\n16) VanDyke\nThis style is similar to the anchor, but with one difference. Instead of rounding off the bottom, the hair is, instead, trimmed to form a point.\n17) Balbo\nThis style resembles an upside-down anchor, with its ends (\u201cflukes\u201d) extended outward along the lower jaw line, just past the sides of the nose. The ends are then squared off.\n18) Handlebar and Chin Puff\nThis style plays up a handlebar mustache, and features a soul patch which is grown past the lower chin and rounded off.\n19) Goatee\nThis style combines a soul patch with a patch of hair on the lower chin. Sidelines extend to just past the lips and are straight and tidy. The bottom of the goatee is rounded off.\n20) Handlebar and Goatee\nJust like the goatee, but add in a handlebar mustache.\n21) Petite Goatee\nLike its name implies, it\u2019s a narrower, more understated version of the goatee, more of a long soul patch, really. Hair is typically trimmed to a point below the lower chin.\n22) Extended Goatee\nAs its name suggests, this style is like the goatee, except for the sides. They are extended along the lower jaw line, coming to points just past the outer corners of the eyelids.\n23) Sparrow\nThink \u201cJack Sparrow\u201d in the Pirates of the Caribbean series of movies. It resembles a long goatee, divided in the middle and each half twisted into a point. The sides may be shaved like a goatee, or they may extend in a fairly narrow line along the lower jawline toward the ear.\n24) Mutton Chops\nThis style takes sideburns to a whole new level. Facial hair is left to grow from ear to lower jaw and ear to approximately a distance extending to the outer corner of the eyelids (resulting in the shape of mutton chops). The entire area below the lower lip is shaved bare. Sides are left relatively bushy. Mutton chops are typically worn with a mustache which connects to the \u201cchops\u201d at its ends.\n25) Friendly Mutton Chops\nAs the name suggests, this style resembles mutton chops, with the major difference being that the \u201cchops\u201d are worn much more closely-shaven.\n26) Hulihee\nThis style could be thought of as mutton chops on steroids. It\u2019s for the truly brave who dare to grow mutton chop hair to extreme lengths. It\u2019s a definite attention-getter.\n27) Dutch/Old Dutch Beard Styles\nAlthough this style resembles a full beard in many ways, it is still considered a partial beard because it only covers the lower half of each jaw and is worn without a mustache. The shape is similar to that of a bib connected to a soul patch.\n28) Hollywoodian\nThis style falls into that gray area between full and partial beard, and there is a little flexibility in how it can be worn and still be considered \u201cHollywoodian.\u201d As you may have guessed, it is named such for its popularity among Hollywood actors. It can best be described as taking the ends of an extended goatee and drawing them outward along the lower jaw either all the way to the sideburn area, or stopping just before it. The top of the beard is typically worn just under the lower cheekbone area. It is always worn with a mustache which connects with the beard at each end. Hair is kept short to medium-length.\n29) Chin Curtain\nThink Old Dutch, except without the soul patch. The width is also much narrower, with the top hairline being just above the lower jaw, and the bottom just below.\n30) Klingon\nThis style was made popular by the Klingon race of the Star Trek series. Its designer based it on the style that was prominent in Victorian times. It looks like a shorter, narrower version of the Dutch, with the added feature of triangular points that turn toward the corners of the mouth.\nFull Beard Styles\n31) Stubble\nThis is a classical look that can be worn either very short to approximately half and inch. The mustache ends blend into the beard.\n32) French Fork\nThis style can be achieved by growing out stubble to about two or more inches. The hair is then shaped into a long and narrow \u201cW\u201d with two points below the lower chin. Sides extend up the jawline to the ear and the mustache meets the beard at its ends.\n33) Ducktail\nIf, instead of shaping the bottom into a \u201cW\u201d you had it trimmed to a point like a \u201cV\u201d instead, you would have a ducktail.\n34) Short Boxed\nThis is the full version of the Van Dyke, with sides extending outward along the jawline and to the ear. The mustache ends are blended into the beard.\n35) Verdi\nThis style resembles a long Balbo, but with sides that extend along the lower jaw to the ear. The bottom is tapered and rounded under the middle of the lower chin.\n36) Garibaldi\nThis could be considered the \u201cfull\u201d cousin of the partial Dutch. It is similar in most every way except that it features a narrow, curved mustache with ends that blend into the beard.\n37) Bandholz Beard Style\nAKA Eric Bandholz was just a regular guy with a passion for beards. He started by competing in a beard-growing contest in 2012. Then he started a blog to unite the bearded community, and within a few years he had a beard empire on his hands, complete with a line of hipster beard products and a beard style named after him. The Bandholdz is similar to, but longer and fuller than, the short boxed and has become something of a contemporary icon for today\u2019s urban beardsmen.\nBeard Hacks for Every Face Shape\nTo look your best, you should choose a style that suits your face shape. Some beard styles just won\u2019t do for certain face shapes, while others can be tweaked a little bit to make them better-suited to your particular face shape. Keep these tips and hacks in mind.\nIf you have a round face: The idea is to try to slightly slim and elongate the lines of your face. For this reason, guys with round faces should stick with shorter beard styles, with or without mustache. It is especially important to keep sideburns neatly trimmed. You can opt for short sideburns that taper into slightly longer hair below the chin if you wish. This will help to accentuate your chin, one of the best features of the round face. If you decide to eschew the beard in favor of just a mustache, you\u2019re in luck\u2026 the round-faced guy can wear virtually any mustache style and look amazing.\nStyles to avoid if you have a round face: Chin Curtain, Dutch, Balbo, Klingon.\nIf you have a square face: You have that chiseled jawline that ladies go crazy over, so the last thing you want to do is take away from it. Your best beard styles are those that keep the hair closest to the sides and jawline trimmed short, with a little more length and fullness under the chin. Avoid trimming to a point at the chin; either round it off wide or taper and slightly round at the bottom.\nStyles to avoid if you have a square face: Hollywoodian, Klingon, Ducktail, Short Boxed, French Fork.\nIf you have an oblong/rectangular face: If your face is more square at the jawline, you\u2019ll want to soften it up a bit, while those that have a more rounded jawline may want to create the illusion of definition with squarer hairlines. With that in mind, opt for styles that are fuller at the sides and shorter at the chin, such as the short boxed.\nStyles to avoid if you have an oblong/rectangular face: Mutton chops/friendly mutton chops, Hulihee, Dutch.\nIf you have an oval face: Ovals are fortunate in that they can pull off just about any beard or mustache shape. If you opt for a trimming your beard to a point below the chin, shorter, rather than longer, hair will be better-suited to the oval-shaped face. If you want to create the illusion of a squarer, more defined jawline, go for a boxier-cut beard, such as the short boxed.\nGuides For Men To Grow Better Beards\nWelcome to Beard Growth World!

            "9": "\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHere you can find a selection of popular Beard Styles where you can find information on how to grow your very own. You can find out what styles celebrities are choosing, where each style originated, what age groups each beard style attracts and of course how to achieve the look you want. There are plenty more beard styles out the to choose but these are our favourite and most popular.\nShort Boxed Beard-\u00a0One of the most popular beards and probably the first beard any man will grow, the short boxed beard has minimal maintenance for a stylish look. It is the perfect road to take if you don\u2019t want it as short as the 5 o\u2019clock shadow but not as long as full on beast mode.\u00a0You can practice cutting in the neckline and cheeks before taking on\u00a0anything more adventurous.\u00a0Another great reason why the Short Boxed Beard is popular is because it relies on your beard\u2019s natural shape and it can complement any face, so no matter what shape or size the beard will suit\u00a0you which is of great importance. It is entirely up to you how long you grow your beard but this versatile style looks great as stubble, medium\u00a0and long length.\nHollywoodian- A\u00a0beard with integrated mustache that is worn on the lower part of the chin and jaw area, without connecting sideburns (Wikipedia).\u00a0The Hollywoodian beard style is similar to a Short Boxed Beard only that the beard and sideburns are not connected and the facial hair\u00a0at the jaw line is longer. Some people say it is just an extended goatee giving your face a broader look. It was a very popular beard back in the day with Hollywood move stars hence the name. Most recently\u00a0you could have seen Zac Efron and Mark Pellegrino sporting this beard showing that it suits any age group making this particular beard just as\u00a0versatile as the Short Boxed Beard. Please note this isn\u2019t a beard just for famous people, it is for you as well!\nGoatee-\u00a0The term goatee was used to describe\u00a0a tuft of hair on the chin as that on the chin of a goat. There is a similarity with a Goatee and our next style Van Dyke but to me personally I see a goatee as to being a lot shorter than a Van Dyke, and also a goatee doesn\u2019t include a mustache, not that you can\u2019t have one, we are just being politically correct for a second\u2026. moving on! This beard style was very popular in the 90\u2019s, wrestling fans will remember Stone Cold Steve Austin rocking a Goatee in the WWF as it was known back then. That doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t popular now, you can find recent pictures of celebrities like Brad Pitt, Ben Affleck and Colin Farrell sporting this timeless piece, showing the Goatee still has a place.\nVan Dyke-\u00a0All though our picture shows the Van Dyke style beard to be basically a Goatee but bigger and with a mustache, the Van Dyke is usually a more pointed goatee. You can start this style from day one stubble shaving the cheeks\u00a0leaving your chin whiskers and mustache intact.\u00a0As your chin Goatee grows longer, you need to use your beard trimmer\u00a0to carefully trim it into a pointed shape. This is not easy so make sure you take your time and do not trim too much off, if you do you can use style wax or beard oil to shape the tip to hide any minor mistake. The most popular celebrities who sport this style regularly is Johnny Depp and Micky Rourke, personally I would say it suits men over 40 but I am sure some people could prove us wrong!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMutton Chops-\u00a0Are patches of facial hair that extend from the hairline to below the ears but stop before the chin. Mutton Chops also known as sideburns get their name from a 19th century United States Senator called Ambrose Burnside.\u00a0His distinctive style of facial hair\u00a0became known as sideburns,\u00a0derived from his last name. The most iconic person to \u2018ROCK\u2019 Mutton Chops was the one and only Elvis Presley so they must be cool! All though not as popular as other beard styles, Mutton Chops\u00a0remain a popular and dramatic style. You would be making some statement if you were to grow these sideburns, but make sure you keep them trimmed to avoid an untidy look.\nThe Zappa-\u00a0Originated with 1940\u2019s born musician Frank Zappa is a thick mustache with a large square off soul patch. This style is popular with\u00a0bikers and rockers and Motley Crue star Tommy Lee can often be seen rocking out with this style. This is one cool beard and pulled off right, this style can really rock for you! For a good-looking Zappa trim your beard to around 3-5mm, trim the outline of your mustache\u00a0so that it extends down towards your chin by about 5cm\u00a0and is\u00a0about 2.5cm wide. We suggest leaving a 2cm gap between your Soul Patch and mustache making the width of the soul patch 3-5cm and 2-3cm in length.\u00a0A Zappa is nice and full, so really let the style grow in don\u2019t be afraid to try different lengths to what we suggest.\n\u00a0\nBalbo-\u00a0Originates from Italian fascist Italo Balbo who was born in 1896 and is one cool beard! Nothing shows how\u00a0bold, stylish and self-confident you are like the Balbo. This beard style is made up of three-parts, including a mustache, soul patch, and a beard that stops before it reaches your sideburns. When Ironman and Batman are rocking this on a regular basis then you know it\u2019s cool! Robert Downey Jr and Christian Bale have been sporting this look for numerous years and it isn\u2019t going away any time soon. To achieve this greatness simply shape a 2-3cm soul patch creating an upside down letter \u2018T\u2019 curving outwards. Then depending on desired length or how wide you chin is you should aim for a beard around 6-8cm wide. Shaving the side burns, neckline and cheeks will give a more prominent look.\n\u00a0\n",

Is it natural for longer facial hair to grow at an angle?\nThanks.\nI have to admit that I laughed when I first got this e-mail, because even though I get a good portion of my traffic from beard related posts, I don\u2019t consider myself to be an authority on beards.  I am, however, someone who has grown a decent number of beards over the years despite a distinct lack of natural beard growing ability.  Maybe there are some men out there who were born to grow perfect beards, but for most of us, getting a beard to look halfway normal takes a little bit of effort.\nAs I typed up a quick response, I realized that although my suggestions were pretty basic, they were the result of years of trial and error, and might be beneficial to other guys whose natural ability is throwing roadblocks onto their roads to beardedness.  If you have a problem with an unruly beard (or know someone who does), here are 7 tips that should help to get those renegade patches back under control.  And they require only a little more effort to implement than growing the beard itself\n7 Ways To Train A Naturally Unruly Beard\n1. Wait It Out: Ever get a whiffle and then try to convert back to your regular hair cut?  There\u2019s a two week period where you have the puffy headed look of a Monchichi, and there isn\u2019t a damn thing that you can do about it.  All you can do is wait for the hair to grow long enough that it falls into place from its own weight.  Your beard can enter transition periods, too, and if you\u2019re particularly lucky, the issues work themselves out on their own.  This isn\u2019t the most reliable way to get a beard back into place, but it certainly requires the least amount of effort.\n2. Stop Washing It Every Day: Don\u2019t let your woman tell you this is gross, because the ladies have been using this trick on their hair forever.  Have you ever taken a good look at a super model\u2019s hair?  It\u2019s like a grease pit because they don\u2019t wash it.  Washing your beard every day makes your beard wiry by stripping out any natural oil that would\u2019ve accumulated to make it manageable.  I\u2019m not suggesting that you never wash your beard again there, Captain Caveman, but washing it every other day will give your beard a little oil buildup to help coax strays back into place.\n3. Condition It Once A Week: If added length hasn\u2019t added enough weight to get the hairs to lay flat, adding a bit of regular hair conditioner to your beard once a week can get some of those strays under control.  I\u2019ve only used regular hair conditioner that #1GF! had laying around, so anyone who says you need special beard conditioner is probably trying to sell you something that does less and costs more than it should\n4. Train It Right: Portions of my beard grow in insane directions, and the only way that I can get them in line is to train them.  In beard season, I tend to carry one of those cheap, black, plastic combs that only your grandfather and barber seem to posses, and run the fine end of it through my beard while watching TV or reading.  Ten or fifteen minutes a day usually takes care of a bulk of the issues.\n5. Train It Wrong: I discovered this tip entirely by accident, but I find that it works fairly well.  On those days that you wash your beard, it will end up more more wiry because you stripped out the oils.  When you get out of the shower on those days, comb your beard in the complete wrong direction and let it air dry.  You will probably look insane, so avoid glaring at or making any sudden movements around any women who may be running around your house.  Once your beard is dry, comb it in the correct direction, and then smooth it down with a barely damp hand.  This will tend to make your beard look a lot bigger than normal, but the hairs learn that your commands will be obeyed.\n6. Try Soap:  Washing your beard with soap will strip out all the oils completely, which seems like it would make your beard less controllable, right?  Well, it does.  The benefit is that the whole beard gets bushier, making the uncontrollable patch blend in.  It doesn\u2019t seem like sound advice to throw the rest of your beard into chaos to hide a chaotic patch, but if the other methods fail and you don\u2019t mind a bushy beard, this may end up being the only thing that works for you.\n7. Weed Out The Trouble Makers: If none of the other methods work, you may have to prune the unruly hairs and rely on its well-trained neighbors to take up the slack.  This happens a lot with grey hairs, which are as impossible to get in line as an old man with tattooed forearms.  If the patch is so out of control that trimming won\u2019t fix it, you may need to simply try a different style.  Remember: there are a lot of beard types that you can choose from, but not all of them were made for your face.\nHope that helps.\nIf you have any other tips on getting your beard under control, be sure to drop them in the comments.\nPost navigation\nJoyce says:\nHey Jon,\nThanks for your work in saving the beard.  I consider you one of the leading thinkers in the field.\nWhat do you recommend in the way of tools for keeping it under control?\nSafety razor kind of hacks things up so I\u2019m thinking of going to a straight razor (which is more manly anyway) to shape it.\nI have been going to the barber to keep it trimmed, but at $5 a pop I\u2019m thinking I should just do it myself.  Do you recommend scissors, dedicated beard trimmers, or just plain old hair trimmers (which is what I think my barber uses).\nYour throne is made from discarded facial hair, my friend.\nAll hail the reluctant KING.\nIs Butch wax the way to go? I met a man with a (I swear this is true I was in Home Depot near the measuring tapes) 16 inch wide handlebar who swore by the stuff. I\u2019ve basically got a modified (by way of lacking enough follicles in the \u2018tween the stache and beard area) van dyke, the beard gets a bit wacky in places and the longer bits of the stache (there to take up slack for the MIA follicles) try to fly away.\nOh. I simply have to come back here, if not just to post an image or two. Cool way to try out different styles, man. :oD\nI too have grown an apprx. 10-12 inch beard in the last four years. Maybe I can upload an avatar one of these days\u2026\nAll the best.\n1) No shaving. At all. Not even trimming\n2) Must be visible after a week.

Gonna try and use some of these tips to outlast the competition. Thanks!\nGreat Site. I will be back. I have worn a beard (except for a couple of shaves for Main Ladies who wanted a real face check) since I got out of the Army in \u201973.  I wasn\u2019t shaving yet when I signed up and stopped when I got out.\nUsual since \u201994 is a shaved head w/moustache and goatee, but most winters I go for the full blown bushy Santa. Since it started turning white this is quite effective and gives one a fresh pallette in January to try out strange stuff during the removal.\nI agree with wax for the stache and butchwax is just as good and cheaper than the little tube your barber will sell you.\nRock on,\nIan says:\nthank you\nat 52 years of age I\u2019ve finally grown some face hair for the very first time, got a sort of \u2018Lemmy\u2019 from Motorhead effort, tried the full jobby but It had more patches than a forty-a-day abstainer, your tips have come in handy, thanks again.\nHi beard grandmaster\nI am currently at day 79 of 120 days growing a beard to raise money for cancer research uk. I have been posting images on a weekly basis on facebook.\nPlease visit my http://www.justgiving.com/wearing-the-beard120 to view my progress.\nMy beard has excellent shape but is extremely thick.  Even though I look older I don\u2019t care it\u2019s great!\nThanks for the advice. I have not yet developed thicker facial hair, I\u2019ve never shaved my face before, but I am now starting to grow thicker mustache hair, chin hair, and side burns. My chin hair is most developed, then the sides, then the mustache, however I wonder why my stache doesn\u2019t connect, like the hair in my philtrum is not as developed.\nI came here because at one point my chin hair was normal, then one day some of it just twisted and went another way.\nLove this post. But I don\u2019t have a beard. I shave my head bald and keep a mustache that is wiry and unruly. Your comments about soap and beard hair make sense, but I can\u2019t avoid washing he mustache while washing my face! So what do I do?\nI got frustrated once before and shaved the thing off. Big mistake!  So I gotta figure something out.\nThanks for the tips.\nI have to disagree with #4 though.  Those cheap black combs are horrible for your beard and can severely damage it.  You\u2019ll want to invest in a nice beard comb, made by Kent for example.\na couple of thoughts here.  Though it wasn\u2019t mentioned I have a trick for those with gray hair. I tried using both men\u2019s and women\u2019s hair coloring and I\u2019m  very sensitive to it. It ate my face up!  Since I have dark hair on the top of my head mostly the very gray mustache and beard look pretty weird. So I had to do something.  I went to a natural food store and found Henna which is a direct that was used by the ancient Egyptians. It turns most of your hair dark with the most stubborn gray hairs a sort of highlighted color. Not bad at all. I get the pre-mixed stuff cause I\u2019m not going to mess with mixing the stuff up. Leave it on an hour and you\u2019re done.\nFor control I use a conditioner, wash it every 3 days with soap and water and use a leave in conditioner.  When ready to leave I will wet it with warm water and brush with fine brush. Then a blast of hairspray and a smoothing with a washcloth. That usually does it though I do keep fine tooth brush in the car and will brush in the afternoon when I travel. Good luck guys.\nAnyone out there not a company rep and can weigh in?\nComment\nName *\nEmail *\nWebsite\n",

            "18": "By                            Two Legs Good\nSo you may have noticed we've only just returned after a while away.  Sorry we've not written for a while, we've been growing a beard.\nOh, all right, it's not just been that.  And yes, we did already have one, but that was a passive beard, a non-active beard, a beard-by-default.  The difference was that we decided that at some point in the future we might not have a beard, and in so doing we realised, therefore, that the last beard before beardlessness would in effect be our ultimate beard.\nOur Ultimate Beard.  Hmmmm.\nQuite apart from the fact that Our Ultimate Beard was already the name of a semi-good semi-famous indie band that once had third billing below The Jesus And Mary Chain and Half-Man-Half-Biscuit back in the 80's, the idea of growing Our Ultimate Beard tickled our fancy.\nThere are so many to choose from, after all...\nWith so much choice available, only a fool would plump for one alone, so we decided to test drive a variety of beards.  Over the heavy winter growing period when our pelt thickens we merely gave an occasional cursory trim to the outside edge, allowing the beard and moustachios to bush up nicely in preparation for the topiary work to come.  Membership of the fine British Beard Club was obtained, and suppliers of wax were sought in preparation for the first of the possible ultimate beards - a combination of Petit Goatee, with Handlebars for garnish.\nNow normally we use a local friendly Italian Barbershop - Franco & Pino 's on the Wickham Road in Shirley, and never have any complaints; they're clean, fast, very friendly and best of all they give a damn fine haircut - the sort of haircut you just can't refuse.\nGood Barbers!\nHowever, this time, this time the other half suggested that what was needed was an old-fashioned gentleman's barbers, something a bit more Hercule Poirot than Al Pacino.  And as luck would have it (bad luck, as it turned out) such a place had opened nearby, The Valet in Addiscombe.\nBad Barber!  Bad, BAD Barber!\nIt took a bit of convincing for us to agree to the change, but eventually we did and off we went.  And before the first hair was cut we'd made sure we'd briefed the barber.  We were growing the beard and moustaches for length - did he understand? Yes, he says, he understands.  We're wanting to grow out a goatee and have long droopy handlebars. Yes, that's fine he says.   Look, just to make sure, let me sketch what we want... ah yes, you see that, you say you understand that.  Fine.\nAnd to be fair it all started well with a decent but unexceptional haircut, but after that it all went wrong.  Deeply, badly wrong.\nHead back, tilted back, eyes closed head massage... relaxing... the snip-snip-snipping as he trims the beard.  And then the tilt forward and\nWHERE'S MY BEARD?\nYOU'VE CUT MY BEARD OFF!\nAnd all the while for the next few minutes he just stands there inanely, barely doing more than smile while we rant and rave and froth and bubble.  For some reason there was very little reaction, as though he still didn't understand - or care - what he'd done.\nAll we were left with was a little tufty chin-cover.  Months upon months of growing gone.  His suggestion?  Maybe that if he trimmed it even narrower it would be the right shape.  Oh yes, the right shape - as seen from a long way away through the wrong end of the telescope!\nHow he could take the idea of something - and the picture was drawn in front of him, mind! - something that was drawn as twice- to three-times longer than wide, and then cut it as something twice- to three-times wider than long is beyond us.  There's only so far down the Stupid Scale we can go before we get headaches and the bends.\nThe length went from about 4.5 inches full stretch to 1.5 inches.  The moustachios similary lost about 2 inches of wingspan.\nHe \"misunderstood\", he said.\nJust how bad a barber do you need to be for that to happen?\nYou just can't make this sort of stupid up.   If it happened in a television sit-com you'd probably think it was lazy writing - no-one could really be that inept.  Wrong!  At The Valet, they really CAN be that bad!\nThe Valet claim that they are \"for those guys who want that little bit more\" - they just couldn't be more wrong if they tried; in our case we ended up with much, much less than we wanted.\n\"So whatever your style requirements are, they will be satisfied here at The Valet.\" they claim.  Ha!   Piffle!  Utter nonsense!\nAnd as for \"we stand for the provision of a quality service to the everyday man where they can escape, relax and enjoy proper male grooming services\", BE WARNED!  This was the worst barbering experience we've ever had.\nSo, thanks to Bodger the Barber at The Valet, I haven't been to a meeting of the British Beard Club for months.   I wouldn't be able to look the other members in the eyes.  I've been living in fear in case a crack squad of Beardy Ninjas come to expose me as a non-beardy, and take my prized club badge away.\nOh, the shame of it.\nSo now you know why we haven't been around, why we haven't shown our face for a while.\nIn the meantime we've been reduced to the \" Oor Wullie \" method of beard growing - rubbing salt into our chin to make the hairs thirsty, then tying a knot in them when they come out for a drink.\n* - I hope that The Justified Sinner doesn't mind me borrowing the old tag-line from his excellent blog.

            "20": "Lead\nTags : None\nHello everybody,\nI've been following this board for a while now, and I really like it, so I figured I'd make a thread myself here. I'm 18 years old and I've been experiencing some beard growth for a couple of years now. When I was like 12/13yo, my stache started to grow (I didn't like it, haha), and around 15yo the rest started to slowly fill in. I've been wanting to grow a full beard for some years now. Last year me and my friends participated in no shave november, but I didn't like the results of it. I think I got a pretty fast growth rate, and my hairs are pretty dark, but I really dislike my coverage, as well as the thickness of my beard (there are, especially on my cheeks, very little hairs per inch). Since last year I seem to have made very little to no improvement, and that discourages me to try having a beard again. As I said, I would really love to have a full beard, but that's just not realistic, at least not now. I have a lot of growth in my neck, but little on the cheeks. Do you guys maybe know some style that would fit me? I have tried a chinstrap before, but I always start to hate my low density, you can see each single hair.\u00a0\nNo shave november photos (30 days after clean shaving):\nAfter carving a neckline\nI really dislike the lack of density here, from a distance you couldn't even notice I had hairs on my cheeks.\nAnd this is how it looks right now, after +-3 days of no shaving:\nI appreciate all your feedback!\nMordax\nCertified Advisor\nThanks for the advice! I will maybe participate in no shave november again this year, and then at the end of it I'll see whether I feel like growing it until the 3 month mark. I just think my \"beard\" looks really messy after like a week of no shaving. I like the full beard look but I don't like looking like someone who doesn't care for his appearance. If anyone has some other advice, I'd love to hear it.\nEdit: Here are 2 more pictures, illustrating what I mean with \"messy\". The first is taken after 31 days of no shaving, and the second after 27 days. I think the messy look comes from the lack of density.\nLast Edited By: Mordax Oct 11 14 12:36 PM.         Edited 2 times.\nAdvertisement\nHey man welcome to the board! I see what you mean by your growth, although I'm not quite where you are yet my growth is similar in that it's strong on the stache, and the rest is mainly under my chin and on my neck. I'd say for now you could just grow it out to see, from the picture at the top of your left side after the neckline carve I'd say you're coming up to a great time for your beard in the upcoming years, but for now it's up to you whether you want to grow it all out just because, or try a neat looking style. It looks to me like you have a strong goatee, soulpatch, and mustache. I'd recommend, if you're looking for a look that makes you look well maintained and clean, to grow a van dyke style beard.\nAnyways, I'd like to encourage you with the fact that you have actually a lot more than the average 18 year old. You're doing really well. Take care!\nBlond hairs all over the place \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nconnector slowly starting to grow.\n\u00a0\nWelcome to the board... your pictures last year with the carved neckline show that you have more potential than you give credit for. You show lots of slower starters in that show and for that reason, I believe your best bet is to let everything grow for 3 months and keep a carved neckline. I would not shave for November... just go right on with your 4 weeks of October coverage and plan to grow to the new year before you think about styles. Keep growing and showing.\n",

            "22": "15 Goatee Styles for Men: The Whole List, Chart, and \u2018Go-to\u2019 Handbook\nThe goatee. You know, that not-quite-a-beard, not-quite-a-mustache style of facial hair that has seen a resurgence in the past several years (and moved beyond its beatnik and counter-cultural reputation of yesteryear). As we have with beards and mustaches, we now present you with a list of goatee styles and an easy-to-reference goatee styles chart.\nDefining what actually constitutes a goatee has been open for debate throughout history. Generally speaking, it combines elements of both a mustache and a beard while leaving the cheeks clean-shaven. It\u2019s also generally accepted that a goatee\u2019s name is derived from the long fur that\u2019s found under the chin of a goat. The half-man, half-goat Greek God Pan is depicted as having a goatee of some sort. Yes, the goatee has been around a long, long time.\nLet\u2019s dig deeper.\nAs mentioned, we\u2019ve included a goatee styles chart that will serve as a quick, but informative, reference guide for anyone who\u2019s looking to learn more about this unique type of facial hair.\nThe whole goatee styles list and \u2018go-to\u2019 handbook\nWhat is it? The classic goatee is just what it implies \u2013 the basic, foundational style of a goatee that so many men wear. Simply put, it\u2019s a tuft of hair on the chin trimmed neatly. Put another way; it\u2019s a chin beard under your bottom lip without a mustache and with your cheeks shaved clean.\nWho is it for? Men with round faces will never go wrong with the classic, goatee-without-mustache look.\nWho wears it? Academy Award-winning actor Benicio del Toro has worn a classic goatee \u2013 and worn it well.\nWhat is it? When people think of goatee, they usually think \u201cfull goatee.\u201d The mustache continues around the side of the mouth to join with the unshaven beard.\nWho is it for? You want to keep hair on your chin if you have a diamond-shaped face and the full goatee meets this requirement.\nWho wears it? Check out actor Will Smith.\nWhat is it? The goatee and mustache is what its name implies: a mustache connected to a goatee. From there, it can be transformed into many different styles, however. But there\u2019s no question that it\u2019s a classic look.\nWho is it for? The goatee and mustache is ideal for men with square faces, who may want to avoid full beards.\nWho wears it? Many, many men have favored this look, from Tom Selleck to Jeff Bridges and beyond.\nWhat is it? The Anchor gets its name because it looks like the nautical ship equipment of old. It\u2019s not easy to pull off but can be done by combining a chinstrap beard with a well-groomed pencil mustache and soul patch that extends to the chin.\nWho is it for? This is another style that will give a round face a narrower look, but it works well with men who have triangular faces, as well.\nWho wears it? One of the many faces of Christian Bale has been graced with an admirable Anchor goatee.\nWhat is it? The extended goatee is a mustache extending into a beard, but without sideburns. Very similar in style to the Hollywoodian beard.\nWho is it for? The extended goatee is a great shape if you have a long (oblong) face.\nWho wears it? Actor Jake Gyllenhaal has sometimes sported an extended goatee, along with several other facial hair styles.\n6. Goatee With Chin Strap\nWhat is it? If nothing else, the chin strap requires discipline. It will need rigorous upkeep to keep it neatly confined to the jawline (while not busting out into a true beard). Combining it with a classic goatee is an interesting look.\nWho is it for? This another solid choice if your face is long/oblong.\nWho wears it?\u00a0Someone, for sure.\n7. Handlebar and Goatee\nWhat is it? A handlebar mustache with a goatee. Neither are connected.\nWho is it for? A long face also provides a good foundation for the handlebar and goatee.\nWho wears it? Saddle up, fellas. American Wild West hero Buffalo Bill sported a handsome handlebar and goatee.\n8. Handlebar and Chin Puff\nWhat is it? This style combines a handlebar mustache with a chin \u201cpuff\u201d that extends downward (kind of like a soul patch on steroids) beneath the chin. A facial style with many identities, it\u2019s also known as the chin strap with a mustache, and the Napoleon III Imperials.\nWho is it for? Check it out, you square- and diamond-faced men.\nWho wears it? Mel Gibson, for one.\n9. Norse Skipper\nWhat is it? The Norse Skipper is a long chin puff that goes no wider than the corners of the mouth. Imagine an upside down teardrop that covers \u2013 and extends a few inches beyond \u2013 the chin.\nWho is it for? If you have a round face, you can use the Norse Skipper to focus attention on your chin, but the Norse Skipper works well with other facial shapes, as well.\nWho wears it? Anthrax guitarist Scott Ian is known for his Norse Skipper, as well as his crunching, heavy-metal riffs.\n10. Petite Goatee\nWhat is it? This type of goatee starts just beneath the lips and extends just beyond the chin to resemble an upside-down teardrop. Let your normal goatee grow for a couple of weeks before shaping it into a petit goatee.\nWho is it for? Square-faced men: this goatee\u2019s for you.\nWho wears it? While there\u2019s nothing petite about the band Metallica\u2019s sound, axeman James Hetfield has been known to wear a Petite Goatee.\n11. Goat Patch\nWhat is it? A nice patch of hair confined exclusively to the chin (while extending beneath the chin). You\u2019re channeling your inner goat with this style.\nWho is it for? The Goat Patch works with most facial shapes, but diamond- and triangular-shaped faces provide an ideal foundation for this style.\nWho wears it? Not overly common among celebs but not unpopular among American baseball players, who have ventured a long way down the facial hair trail ever since the Draconian reign of team owners and managers during the sport\u2019s \u201cGolden Era\u201d was finally loosened.\nWhat is it? Simply put, the Soul Patch is a short patch of hair beneath your bottom lip. One of its strengths is its versatility because it can be blended with many different facial hair styles without having to be altered.\nWho is it for? The Soul Patch can also help elongate the look of a round face.\nWho wears it? Actor Kevin Costner has been seen with a Soul Patch, which was also worn by blues guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan.\nWhat is it? The Balbo has been referred to as a beard with two or three sections. It\u2019s a mustache combined with hair on the chin, including a soul patch.\nWho is it for? The Balbo is a nice fit for square- and diamond-shaped faces.\nWho wears it? Named for Italo Balbo, a Mussolini goon during World War II, it has been well-represented in modern times by actor Robert Downey Jr.\nWhat is it? Isn\u2019t this what they always used to call goatees? Seems like it, especially if you remember the 1960s and 1970s of American culture. But, to the point, a Van Dyke specifically refers to a mustache and hair on the chin with the rest of the face shaved clean. You can spice it up with a handlebar mustache.\nWho is it for? A man with a longer face and pointed chin would look particularly good with a Van Dyke because it would help make the chin appear more rounded.\nWho wears it? The Van Dyke is named after the 17th century Flemish painter Anthony van Dyck, whose self-portraits helped popularize the look. Many men wear it today or have worn it, including actor Johnny Depp.\n15. Rap Industry Standard\nWhat is it? It\u2019s popular among rappers, hence the name. It consists of a pencil-thin ring around the mouth that skirts the top lip, follows the sides of the mouth down to the jaw, as well as following the jawline along the chin. The key is keeping it thin \u2013 very thin.\nWho is it for? The Rap Industry Standard is a good choice for men with round faces because it will narrow the face at the sides and make it seem slightly longer.\nWho wears it? Rapper extraordinaire Kanye West has worn the Rap Industry Standard.\nThe Goatee: A Turbulent History\nThough certainly popular in more recent popular culture, the goatee has, well, a sort of dubious history. As mentioned, the half-man, half-goat Greek god Pan is usually depicted as having some sort of goatee. He was considered the god of shepherds but was also a symbol of wildness . And then you throw Satan into the famous-goatees-from-history mix \u2013 thanks to Christian imagery \u2013 to really give the goatee a pagan reputation.\nThe goatee, perhaps because of frightening imagery (or, imagery that was intended to frighten and keep mortal souls on the right path) never really became popular until Anthony Van Dyck in the 17th century. Van Dyck\u2019s self-portraits, as well as his paintings of King Charles I, brought the goatee into the mainstream \u2013 or at least into more polite, sophisticated circles beyond half-animal humans and the Devil.\nHowever, there may be other reasons why the goatee, at first glance, was alarming back in the day. Researchers suggest that its downward triangle shape sends a subconscious warning bell. Combine that with demonic imagery and you had the element of danger neatly contained within a suddenly popular facial hair style.\nThe goatee, like many things, gained and lost popularity in the ensuing centuries. Napoleon famously wore won, as did Buffalo Bill and General Custer before he succumbed to the Battle of Little Bighorn beatdown. Other famous wearers include Abraham Lincoln, Colonel Sanders of Kentuck Fried Chicken fame, Frank Zappa, Che Guevara, Steve Austin \u2013 and many, many more.\nIn America, the goatee re-emerged on the popular scene thanks to jazz musicians and beatniks (or, Beats) of the 1940s before waning, but then found new life in the 1960s as a \u201ccounter-culture\u201d look (once again, the goatee veers from the beaten path), and in popular entertainment was worn by folks such as \u201chippie\u201d cartoon character Shaggy Rogers of the Scooby Doo series and actor Bob Denver as the beatnik Dobie Gillis. Of course, Denver was clean-shaven for his role as Gilligan on the TV sitcom Gilligan\u2019s Island. And before that, bohemians in Paris favored the goatee in the later 19th century. French poet Charles Baudelaire wore a beard/mustache combo from time to time.\nThe 1970s saw the emergence of the mustache \u2013 it seemed like everyone\u2019s dad wore one, some successfully \u2013 but the goatee dipped its toe back into the water in the 1980s when stubble became fairly popular again.\nIn the 1990s, and continuing today in what\u2019s considered the \u201cGolden Age\u201d of goatees, the goatee became a safe-bet, mainstream look. A \u201cmountain man\u201d beard signified rebellion more than the goatee and other facial hair styles). Everyone\u2019s dad has traded in his mustache for a goatee, or so it seems, and aging country musicians and minor celebrities such as Larry the Cable Guy and the chef Guy Fieri have helped to further implant the goatee into the public\u2019s consciousness. Grunge rocker Kurt Cobain made it more acceptable to the younger generation.\nThere are other reasons why the goatee has become a go-to look for many men, including the fact that it\u2019s relatively easy to grow no matter what style you choose. Men in their late teens or early 20s who are still a step or two removed from being able to grow a true full beard can grow a goatee because hair on the upper lip and chin tends to come in more densely than other parts of the face. Race may also play a role; African-American men may find it more difficult to grow a beard (or find that it comes in more patchy than men of other races) and opt for a goatee instead.\nBut that\u2019s not to say, of course, that men of all races shouldn\u2019t try to grow all sorts of beards. You\u2019ll never know unless you try, or as they say in the American lottery business, \u201cYou can\u2019t win if you don\u2019t play.\u201d And whether it\u2019s a goatee, mustache, or beard, we believe that everyone can win.\nThe goatee is a style that has withstood the test of time while surviving the ever-turbulent waters of changing styles and preferences.\u00a0 No matter how you envision yourself: bon vivant, metalhead, rapper, R & B fan, or \u201cdevilish,\u201d there\u2019s a high likelihood that there\u2019s a goatee style for you.\nThere are also a couple of styling tips to keep in mind if the goatee. First, pay close attention to the edge while shaving. Your beard shouldn\u2019t extend beyond the smile lines of your mouth.\u00a0 Also, make sure both sides of the goatee are symmetrical; in any case, maintain sharp edges and corners at the jawline if you choose a mustache and a beard .\nA place where manliness and beards thrive in harmony.\nBaldingBeards is THE resource for facial hair, hair loss, personal grooming, (relevant) product reviews and manly entertainment.\nWe post new content every month and it's generally long, comprehensive and thorough.

            "27": "Pastors these days like to wear beards.\u00a0 So says Leadership Journal, published by Christianity Today, whose blog shows the various styles preferred by various kinds of pastors.\u00a0 I reproduce them here, adding also a distinctly Lutheran kind of beard.\nWhat I like is the beard of 17th century Lutheran orthodoxy:\nI don\u2019t know any pastors today who look like this, but we need to bring this beard\u2013associated also with Buffalo Bill-type frontiersmen\u2013back into fashion.\nAbout Gene Veith\nI am a retired English professor and college administrator.  I have written over 20 books on different facets of Christianity & Culture.\nPete\nThe Matt Harrison/Teddy Roosevelt mustache is reasonably hip, I\u2019d say.  (Although, according to my kids, my hipness cred is almost undetectable.)\nSharon Philp\nWhen I was in Lutheran college two decades ago, goatees were becoming popular. None of your soul-patch goatees, just regular, cover-the main chin hair. Our choir director had a strict dress code for choir tours, including a \u201cno-facial-hair-on-choir-tour\u201d rule. That meant all the goatees had to go, for which almost everyone else was grateful.  The males who wore them complained, especially when our director made an exception to a second-career choir member who had a well-groomed beard, and had had one for years.  Call me biased, but the clean-shaven and the well-groomed men in our choir looked good when compared with the funny stubble one sees these days, especially on seminarians.  It looks like the unchecked facial hair of the baseball players who do not shave during the post-season, so as not to break the luck. Then I think of how my choir director would be very sad if he could see how these soon-to-be pastors dressed and shaved. Appearance does not make the man, indeed; however, should not men who are or are preparing to stand \u201cin the stead and by the command\u201d of Christ now wish to groom with that in mind?\nhttp://www.utah-lutheran.blogspot.com Bror Erickson\nMy wife likes me to have a scruffy face, she doesn\u2019t like the beard, and she doesn\u2019t like clean shaven. She\u2019s happy, I\u2019m happy.\nKathy\nBror @3 \u2013 I\u2019m with your wife.  I like the scruffy look, seems more masculine than the clean-shaven face.  I say, \u201cLet men be men.\u201d They\u2019re emasculated enough in our society.  I would prefer that men don\u2019t choose the Orthodox or Angry Whiskers look.\nhttp://www.brandywinebooks.net Lars Walker\nI believe that pastoral beards are going out of style in the ELCA, because\u2026 well, because they soon won\u2019t have any male pastors left at all.\nSKPeterson\nMy wife determines my facial hair as well.  I have a goatee, which I grew about 10 years or so ago and have kept since.  I grown it fairly long, almost like the goat pharaoh, but also trimmed neat like the plain guru.  However, my wife also likes the scruff , which generally means I shave on Sunday\u2019s and trim the goatee back every few weeks at the same time.\nSKPeterson\nLars @ 5 \u2013 Just because there won\u2019t be any male pastors, does not mean ELCA clergy will abandon beards!\nHippoAugustine\nThanks for this.  I almost spit my coffee out on my keyboard.\nWhen I was in seminary,   about 50% had beards.   I thought they did it because it made them feel like the apostles.    I encouraged them to wear tunics and sandals but there were no takers.\nRandom Lutheran\nI\u2019ve never understood why society wants men to cut off their real faces. Sure, there will be some men who just can\u2019t grow a decent beard (patchy, etc.), but most can and should. The societal preference for the so-called \u201cclean-shaven look\u201d is just a means to continually infantilize men.\nBryan Lindemood\nI think I want to get one of those retro-doily collars so I can grow out my hair and begin some new purpose-driven winter beard sculpting!  Dude! That would be so awesome.\nJon\nO, Father Hollywood (Pr. Beane)?!  Just sayin\u2019 he could easily coif his mane, sculpt the Buffalo Bill and sport the ruffled collar.\nAnd I\u2019ve had an LCMS pastor with a ponytail and full beard. Rode a Hog, too.  Though he usually went with at least a clerical shirt and collar.\nDr Luther in the 21st Century\nBeen rocking the goatee since college and I have no plans to ever shave it off.  Easy to maintain and it helps soften the baby face look.  I will be the first to say, I am happy beards have come back into fashion.  Kept properly trimmed, they give an air of dignity.  Also, they are nice and warm in the winter months.\nhttp://www.bikebubba.blogspot.com bike bubba\nAmen to #7.  Who are you, Lars, to discriminate against women and tell them they shouldn\u2019t be growing beards?\n(a friend of mine from college noted that her opinion is that men shouldn\u2019t wear earrings and women shouldn\u2019t wear beards, though\u2013you\u2019re not alone, Lars)\nLost in the array of beards is a very simple question; can a pastor wear a beard without trying to \u201cprove something\u201d with it?  Can my Van Dyck simply be \u201cthe beard that lengthens my face and looks OK\u201d rather than trying to prove I\u2019m Calvin, guru, or goat Pharaoh?\nCount me out on the handlebar mustasche and goatee, though.  Too much work waxing it to get it there!\nhttp://www.cyberbrethren.com Rev. Paul T. McCain\nThe history of clerical facial hair in the Church is really quite interesting, in fact, it became a mark of confession between the Eastern and Western Church where. In the East facial hair became mandatory, and, as far as I know, except for some exceptions in Western Rite type of Eastern Church expressions, it is still mandatory that members of their clergy must have a beard. In the West, just the opposite was true. Clean shaven was mandatory throughout the Middle Ages. You\u2019ll note, for example, Martin Luther remained clean shaven throughout his entire life, except for that period of time when he was trying to do incognito after the Diet of Worms in 1521.\nAfter Luther, however, Lutheran theologians generally sported beards, etc. Here, for example, is the great Martin Chemnitz, the prime mover behind the Book of Concord\u2019s compilation.\nI look at the \u201cAngry Whiskers\u201d and I see Rasputin!\ntODD\nI\u2019m sorry, but the picture of the Hawg Preacher clearly depicts U2\u2019s The Edge, not an actual Harley rider.\nI do think the Anabaptist look is poised to go big soon. Personally, I\u2019ve been thinking of shaving off my moustache due to my antipathy towards the English.\nAlso, that looks less like a \u201cPuritan\u201d and more like a 17th-Century French Cardinal. Just sayin\u2019.\nAnyhow, as my avatar here makes clear, I\u2019ve been be-bearded since shortly before I became a dad. It started as winter laziness, and now my wife says she likes it, and I\u2019m certain it would traumatize the kids (and possibly the wife) to see my naked chin. After all, they\u2019ve never seen it in all their lives. Also, I remain lazy. The nice thing about a full beard is that (1) what there is to shave isn\u2019t a lot (sorry, neckbeards remain a no), and (2) I can get away with shaving that once a week, on Sundays.\nhttp://geochristian.wordpress.com/ Kevin N\nI met a Romanian Baptist pastor who was convinced it was sinful for a pastor to grow a beard. I guess he reasoned that if the Orthodox priests have beards, then beards must be of the devil.\nTrey\nI think pastors ought to be some whaf well groomed and not look like a hobo. I\u2019m okay with a little scruff or clean goatte or sole patch, but some are just unkempt and hideous. Unfortunately we live in a superficial culture where some will avoid such people.\nNils\nI\u2019ve had a beard ever since I decided not to shave when doing an excavation summer in Turkey.  Now, I have no recollection of what I look like without it.\nJoanne\nI\u2019m intimidated by my hairdresser.  Every time I go, which is maybe a little less than twice a year, I suggest that maybe we could put a little red in, or more blond with highlights.  And, every time she says, No, you\u2019d never keep it up and only have long roots in the wrong color.   She\u2019s right of course, going only just a little less than  twice a year would not be nearly enough to keep the roots in the right color.  Still, I resent it when she just refuses with a kurt NO, and then trims my hair the way she always does.  I\u2019ve actually hated, all my life, to go get my hair cut/done.  Hairdressers are the bain of my life.  Still, ah, there was a time in my life when I lived in South Florida when I maintained quite a bit of red fairly well and I liked the lady at Jordan Marshes salon.  The root thing got me there at least 4 or 5 times a year, but nothing lasts forever.  Sigh.  My over-spent youth.\nNow as we all learned in \u201cThe Life of Brian,\u201d a beard can be purchased, if one haggles properly.   I think I\u2019d just get a utiltarian face coverer for stonings and such like.  Light, but of no particular color.\nhelen\nJoanne,\nIf you only see your hairdresser twice a year, why see her at all?\nWhen I had my wrist in a cast I couldn\u2019t wash my hair, so I found a salon which does it very reasonably, and I\u2019ve continued the practice.  But I trim it myself, from time to time. And that\u2019s all.  My red has gone dark over the years, as red does after 25 or so, but hey, better than grey!\n[It does \u201cfrost\u201d my silver haired cousin.]\nIn a big library, you see everything in the way of facial hair.  Or not.  And pony tails, too\nhttp://pekoponian.blogspot.com pekoponian\nRandom Lutheran @9- Right on!  I find clean shaven men slightly odd looking.\nAnyone else notice that the Perennial YOuth Pastor lokks just like one of the recurring Lutheran Satire charachters?\nCRB\nA few years ago, I suggested to my wife that I wanted to grow a full beard as opposed to what could be described as, closer to The Spurgeon\u201d look that I have now.  She said, \u201cOK, then you wont mind if I don\u2019t shave my legs?\u201d\nBecky F.\nMy husband is clean-shaven pastor because his facial hair grows in very patchy. He tried a mustache/goatee during 4th year of Seminary, and it looked OK, but he does look better without. I\u2019ve always liked facial hair on men because my father always had at least a mustache after he and my mom were married, and he\u2019s had a beard before and now regularly has a goatee. Nicely kept facial hair can look dignified.\nDaryl II\nSome years ago, I grew a goatee while on vacation, and kept it. Now that the hair is more gray than blond, I became curious as to how I would look without it, so recently I shaved it off. Immediately, I allowed the goatee to grow back\u2026 I decided it was easier to keep it neatly groomed and dyed, than to deal with the lines and wrinkles I hadn\u2019t realized it was hiding.\nhttp://tdaviddemarest.com Trent\n\u201cThe Wartburg\u201d really should be represented here, but, unsurprisingly, the Lutherans\u2019 contribution to the game is overlooked again. Sigh.\nFr. Charles McClean (a septuagenarian Lutheran pastor) informed me that mustaches are against Canon Law. Either a full beard or clean-shaven, but no \u2018staches. So, who wants to go on a mustached-Catholic-priest-hunt with me? We can tell on him to his bishop. All we need are some good walking shoes and Instagram.\nGET PATHEOS NEWSLETTERS\nGet the Best of Patheos Newsletter\nGet the Evangelical Newsletter\nGet the Cranach Newsletter\n",

            "35": "Beards: Historical Presentation\n(the bearded races of mankind have commonly held the beard in high honor)\nPhilosophum non facit barba: \"A beard does not make a man a philosopher.\"\nBeards, Past and Present\nThe beard, in modern usage, refers to the hair grown on a man's face (chin and cheek); while \"mustache\" or \"moustache\" refers to the hair on the upper lip.\nThe bearded races of mankind have commonly held the beard in high honor. It is the sign of full manhood; the very young male or the eunuch is beardless, and the bearded woman was considered to be witch. Adam, the primal man, and the God and prophets of many faiths have been traditionally pictured with beards, as were kings and nobles and dignitaries.\nBeards have assumed all shapes and lengths, some being cultivated to lengths exceeding a man's height while Islamic people still hold the beard in high esteem.\nEgyptian-style beard example for high-ranking Egyptians\nThe earliest records indicate that the highest ranking Egyptians grew hair on their chins.\nThey frizzed, dyed or hennaed (moderate or strong reddish brown to strong brown), and sometimes plaited the beard with interwoven gold thread.\nLater, a metal, false beard or postiche, which was a sign of sovereignty, was worn by queens as well as kings.\nThis was held in place by a ribbon tied over the head and attached to a gold chin strap, a fashion existing from about 3000 B.C. To 1580 B.C.\nAn example of a Mesopotamian civilization beard style\nThe Mesopotamian civilizations (Chaldean, Babylonian, Assyrian, Median, Aramean, and ancient Persian) devoted great care to oiling and dressing their beards, using tongs or curling irons to create elaborate ringlets and frizzles, in a tiered effect\nAssyrians resorted to a black dye for eyebrows, hair, and beard; while the Persians used henna which produced an orange-red color, a style that existed from 1900 B.C.\nGold dust, gold thread, and scented yellow starch were sometimes used in the hair and the beard for festive occasions.\nIn ancient India and Turkey, the beard was allowed to grow long, a symbol of dignity and of wisdom.\nTo cut the beard was infamy among the Turks; slaves were shaved as a mark of servility.\nJewish patriarchal beard style\nPatriarchs of the tribes of Israel grew beards embellished by a hanging earlock (peyot); the peyot is still worn by some very pious orthodox Jews.\nThe Greeks and one of their beard styles\nBeards predominated among the Greeks until 323 B.C., at which time Alexanter the Great ordered his soldiers to be clean shaven, fearing that their beards would serve as handles for their enemies to grab and to hold the Greek soldier as he was killed.\nGrecian beards were frequently curled with tongs to create hanging curls.\nThe Etruscans of northern Italy (about 1000 B.C.) favored the Asian fashion of the long beard, which was eventually handed on to the Romans.\nOne of the Roman styles of beards\nThe Romans apparently thought the Greek style of curled beard was too effeminate, and preferred a trim, well-groomed shape.\nThe use of the razor was encouraged in Rome by Lucius Tarquinius Priscus (616-578 B.C.), in an effort towards hygienic reform.\nShaving did not come into general use until about 454 B.C., when a group of Greek Sicilin barbers went to the mainland from Sicily.\nBarber shops were situated on the main streets, but were patronized only by those who could not afford to have slaves.\nThe Greeks and Romans of the ancient days mostly shaved, and the term barbarous (beard-wearing) was applied for a long period to people who were considered out of the realm of polite society.\nScipio Africanus, according to Pliny, was the first Roman to shave daily.\nPhilosophers continued to keep their beards.\nA Byzantine beard style\nThe Byzantine civilizaton favored beards and mustaches, and the hair moderately short, a combination of oriental and Roman origin, which later influenced medieval and Renaissance Europe.\nFrom the 7th to 16th centuries, the beards of Byzantium were curled, split on the center of the chin, square cut or pointed and some were extremely long.\nBy the end of the 12th century, the Greek, Roman, and oriental influences disappeared, and the cities of Florence and Venice started to set the style for the courts of Europe.\nEuropean transitions\nUntil the advent of Christianity in the 7th century, all Anglo-Saxons wore beards; members of the clergy were then compelled by law to shave.\nEnglish princes wore mustaches until William I by law (1066-87) compelled them to cut them off in accordance with the Norman fashion.\nThe Crusades were perhaps accountable for the return of beards, and for more than four centuries great diversity was allowed: beards, mustaches, and shaven faces all coexisted.\nThe Renaissance fashion in Europe included both clean-shaven faces and beards varying in shape and length.\nMany men starched their beards in the 1560s.\nIn England, Henry VIII (1509-47) brought the beard back into favor in 1535, after which beards of all shapes and lengths were worn.\nThe Vandyke style became popular for many men\nThe Flemish painter, Sir Anthony Vandyke (1599-1641) painted so many aristocrats with a pointed type of beard that it became known as the Vandyke beard. They were dressed with pomade or wax, applied with a tiny brush and comb.\nOther gadgets were used to keep the mustache and beard in shape while sleeping.\nThere were many other beard styles over the centuries a few of which are shown here\nIn 1637, Louis XIII triumphed over the Spanish influence when he amused himself by shaving his courtiers, leaving only a tiny lip beard \"a la royale\" or \"la mouche\", a custom adopted by the French and Dutch cavaliers.\nThe \"imperial\", a pointed tuft of whiskers on the chin, was named in honor of Napolean III, in the 19th century.\nIn the 19th century, long side whiskers merging into a mustache became known as the \"Franz Josef\" in honor of the emperor of Austria\nDuring the Victorian period, from about 1840 to 1870, London set the fashion for the world. Side whiskers developed a longer, more luxuriant growth and were sometimes referred to as \"mutton chops\" or \"Piccadily weepers\".\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094Information, including images, primarily from\nEncycopedia Britannica, Wlilliam Benton, Publisher; Chicago; 1968.\n",

            "37": "\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHere you can find a selection of popular Beard Styles where you can find information on how to grow your very own. You can find out what styles celebrities are choosing, where each style originated, what age groups each beard style attracts and of course how to achieve the look you want. There are plenty more beard styles out the to choose but these are our favourite and most popular.\nShort Boxed Beard-\u00a0One of the most popular beards and probably the first beard any man will grow, the short boxed beard has minimal maintenance for a stylish look. It is the perfect road to take if you don\u2019t want it as short as the 5 o\u2019clock shadow but not as long as full on beast mode.\u00a0You can practice cutting in the neckline and cheeks before taking on\u00a0anything more adventurous.\u00a0Another great reason why the Short Boxed Beard is popular is because it relies on your beard\u2019s natural shape and it can complement any face, so no matter what shape or size the beard will suit\u00a0you which is of great importance. It is entirely up to you how long you grow your beard but this versatile style looks great as stubble, medium\u00a0and long length.\nHollywoodian- A\u00a0beard with integrated mustache that is worn on the lower part of the chin and jaw area, without connecting sideburns (Wikipedia).\u00a0The Hollywoodian beard style is similar to a Short Boxed Beard only that the beard and sideburns are not connected and the facial hair\u00a0at the jaw line is longer. Some people say it is just an extended goatee giving your face a broader look. It was a very popular beard back in the day with Hollywood move stars hence the name. Most recently\u00a0you could have seen Zac Efron and Mark Pellegrino sporting this beard showing that it suits any age group making this particular beard just as\u00a0versatile as the Short Boxed Beard. Please note this isn\u2019t a beard just for famous people, it is for you as well!\nGoatee-\u00a0The term goatee was used to describe\u00a0a tuft of hair on the chin as that on the chin of a goat. There is a similarity with a Goatee and our next style Van Dyke but to me personally I see a goatee as to being a lot shorter than a Van Dyke, and also a goatee doesn\u2019t include a mustache, not that you can\u2019t have one, we are just being politically correct for a second\u2026. moving on! This beard style was very popular in the 90\u2019s, wrestling fans will remember Stone Cold Steve Austin rocking a Goatee in the WWF as it was known back then. That doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t popular now, you can find recent pictures of celebrities like Brad Pitt, Ben Affleck and Colin Farrell sporting this timeless piece, showing the Goatee still has a place.\nVan Dyke-\u00a0All though our picture shows the Van Dyke style beard to be basically a Goatee but bigger and with a mustache, the Van Dyke is usually a more pointed goatee. You can start this style from day one stubble shaving the cheeks\u00a0leaving your chin whiskers and mustache intact.\u00a0As your chin Goatee grows longer, you need to use your beard trimmer\u00a0to carefully trim it into a pointed shape. This is not easy so make sure you take your time and do not trim too much off, if you do you can use style wax or beard oil to shape the tip to hide any minor mistake. The most popular celebrities who sport this style regularly is Johnny Depp and Micky Rourke, personally I would say it suits men over 40 but I am sure some people could prove us wrong!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMutton Chops-\u00a0Are patches of facial hair that extend from the hairline to below the ears but stop before the chin. Mutton Chops also known as sideburns get their name from a 19th century United States Senator called Ambrose Burnside.\u00a0His distinctive style of facial hair\u00a0became known as sideburns,\u00a0derived from his last name. The most iconic person to \u2018ROCK\u2019 Mutton Chops was the one and only Elvis Presley so they must be cool! All though not as popular as other beard styles, Mutton Chops\u00a0remain a popular and dramatic style. You would be making some statement if you were to grow these sideburns, but make sure you keep them trimmed to avoid an untidy look.\nThe Zappa-\u00a0Originated with 1940\u2019s born musician Frank Zappa is a thick mustache with a large square off soul patch. This style is popular with\u00a0bikers and rockers and Motley Crue star Tommy Lee can often be seen rocking out with this style. This is one cool beard and pulled off right, this style can really rock for you! For a good-looking Zappa trim your beard to around 3-5mm, trim the outline of your mustache\u00a0so that it extends down towards your chin by about 5cm\u00a0and is\u00a0about 2.5cm wide. We suggest leaving a 2cm gap between your Soul Patch and mustache making the width of the soul patch 3-5cm and 2-3cm in length.\u00a0A Zappa is nice and full, so really let the style grow in don\u2019t be afraid to try different lengths to what we suggest.\n\u00a0\nBalbo-\u00a0Originates from Italian fascist Italo Balbo who was born in 1896 and is one cool beard! Nothing shows how\u00a0bold, stylish and self-confident you are like the Balbo. This beard style is made up of three-parts, including a mustache, soul patch, and a beard that stops before it reaches your sideburns. When Ironman and Batman are rocking this on a regular basis then you know it\u2019s cool! Robert Downey Jr and Christian Bale have been sporting this look for numerous years and it isn\u2019t going away any time soon. To achieve this greatness simply shape a 2-3cm soul patch creating an upside down letter \u2018T\u2019 curving outwards. Then depending on desired length or how wide you chin is you should aim for a beard around 6-8cm wide. Shaving the side burns, neckline and cheeks will give a more prominent look.\n\u00a0\n",

I think in a few weeks you'll have a better idea on how its coming in.  Not that I think it will impact your beard at all but just to the left of the center of your chin it looks like you might have a bit of a scar?  Just curious if that is the case or a natural spot.\nI'd keep it growing and update along the way so more advice and opinions can be provided.  Looking good so far though.\nHonorary Beard Advocate\nGood luck.\nMore\nThat's actually good to hear.  WHen I look at it up close I feel like the density is an issue.  I actually semi-tried a few years back but after 2-3 weeks I shaved it because it looked like a little porcupine. But this is my first \"committed\" attempt. \u00a0This time though I'll let it go because it seems like others say it lays down after a while.\n3 months is a big commitment, but I guess I'll know for sure if I can do it by then.\nThanks and I'll keep posting pictures.\nMore\nModerator\nMore\nMore\nKeep growing. Get bearded!\nMore\njasjes wrote:\nWelcome to the board. It appears that you are an ESL teacher in Korea and you say half asian.. were you born in Korea? Reason I ask is that our adopted son was born in Korea and I can tell you that you have far better coverage than him. One thing Koreans have going is their dark hair which can help to give appearance of better coverage. In your case, I agree with other comments that you have pretty good coverage to sport a stache/goatee combination and I think this will look very good on you. I encourage you to stick with it for couple more months and see if it's a look that will suit you also. Good luck.\nYes, I'm a teacher here in Korea. \u00a0I was born and raised in New Hampshire though. \u00a0One of the few asian country boys you may ever meet! \u00a0Bailed hay and cut firewood my whole life there - lol.\nYou remind me of one of my uncles actually - he has the same beard as you do. \u00a0I think that's awesome that you adopted a child from Korea. \u00a0One of my good friends from college was adopted and taught English in Korea when she graduated. \u00a0Now she is married with children teaching in Abu Dhabi and doing quite well as her husband teaches too. \u00a0She's one of my favorite people in the world and her kids are totally awesome.\nWe'll keep our fingers crossed for the goatee. \u00a0As I've gotten older, hair grew thicker on my face. \u00a0I don't think folks like facial hair all that much here, but hey - I'm a foreigner. \u00a0They'll make concessions!\nMore\nI already like you because of the things you have shared, lol.\nYour goat looks perfectly fine. Judging from your moustache shadow, I guess you could even pull the 'stache+goatee combo. Just give it time, that is the key, as other said. Do NOT give up after just 3 weeks. Give it at least 8 and then re-evaluate.\nMore\nYou seem to have a good attitude about growing your first goatee. I don't think it will look \"spindly\" after a few weeks, maybe a little scruffy - but this is the case for ~99% of guys in that early stage. Watched a few of your videos. Cool stuff; very informative. I'm thinking about teaching ESL somewhere in the future because I really want to travel and get situated in a new country (not sure which but South Korea is interesting for me).\nWas interested in your \"they'll make concessions\" comment. Sort of reminded me of the phenomena on Chinese TV where foreigners are stereotyped as cute and vulnerable. That's probably not what you were going for. I'm guess what you meant was more about cultural difference? That was my first thought about it though.\nLast Edited By: Bearding Aug 10 12 11:32 AM.         Edited 1 times.\nMore\nThanks for all the encouragement.  I'm gonna give it an honest try - even if the students laugh at me!\nBearding - I think you should definitely travel abroad.  It will be a great experience and you will grow.  Lots of highs and lows.  Korea is a great plave to start because there are many opportunities and it's centrally located in Asia.  Check out www.Teachaway.com.  They are one of the biggest and have all the information about all the countries around the world with opportunities.\nMore\nModerator\nMore\nHonorary Beard Advocate\nMore\nHonorary Beard Advocate\nModerator\nMore\ntgates209 wrote:\nMy main concern is if the hair will lay down and not stick out too much.\u00a0\u00a0\nRight and it will lay against the skin\u00a0but it's got to get quite a bit longer before that happens. One thing I think helps is to brush the goatee down and toward the back with something like a boar-hair brush (not plastic) periodically during the day. Also you might consider to\u00a0rub in\u00a0a tiny amount of jojoba oil each morning. Just have patience getting it to cooperate with your wishes.\u00a0\nMore\nMore\nOk I'll try brushing it back as it grows.\nI was thinking today that it's probably similar to my sideburns when I grow them.  At first it doesn't look life much but once the hair has grown to the point where I can comb it and put some gel in it, they look perfectly fine.  Hopefully the same will happen with the goatee.  All in all, I'm pretty happy with the progress so far.\nMore\nHere is Week 3 progress...smiling this time so I don't look too psycho.\nThe redness on my chin is not related to dryness or anything beard related. \u00a0I practice judo and brazilian jiu jitsu so these marks just show up from time to time.\nHonorary Beard Advocate\n",

It is the sign of full manhood; the very young male or the eunuch is beardless, and the bearded woman was considered to be witch. Adam, the primal man, and the God and prophets of many faiths have been traditionally pictured with beards, as were kings and nobles and dignitaries.\nBeards have assumed all shapes and lengths, some being cultivated to lengths exceeding a man's height while Islamic people still hold the beard in high esteem.\nEgyptian-style beard example for high-ranking Egyptians\nThe earliest records indicate that the highest ranking Egyptians grew hair on their chins.\nThey frizzed, dyed or hennaed (moderate or strong reddish brown to strong brown), and sometimes plaited the beard with interwoven gold thread.\nLater, a metal, false beard or postiche, which was a sign of sovereignty, was worn by queens as well as kings.\nThis was held in place by a ribbon tied over the head and attached to a gold chin strap, a fashion existing from about 3000 B.C. To 1580 B.C.\nAn example of a Mesopotamian civilization beard style\nThe Mesopotamian civilizations (Chaldean, Babylonian, Assyrian, Median, Aramean, and ancient Persian) devoted great care to oiling and dressing their beards, using tongs or curling irons to create elaborate ringlets and frizzles, in a tiered effect\nAssyrians resorted to a black dye for eyebrows, hair, and beard; while the Persians used henna which produced an orange-red color, a style that existed from 1900 B.C.\nGold dust, gold thread, and scented yellow starch were sometimes used in the hair and the beard for festive occasions.\nIn ancient India and Turkey, the beard was allowed to grow long, a symbol of dignity and of wisdom.\nTo cut the beard was infamy among the Turks; slaves were shaved as a mark of servility.\nJewish patriarchal beard style\nPatriarchs of the tribes of Israel grew beards embellished by a hanging earlock (peyot); the peyot is still worn by some very pious orthodox Jews.\nThe Greeks and one of their beard styles\nBeards predominated among the Greeks until 323 B.C., at which time Alexanter the Great ordered his soldiers to be clean shaven, fearing that their beards would serve as handles for their enemies to grab and to hold the Greek soldier as he was killed.\nGrecian beards were frequently curled with tongs to create hanging curls.\nThe Etruscans of northern Italy (about 1000 B.C.) favored the Asian fashion of the long beard, which was eventually handed on to the Romans.\nOne of the Roman styles of beards\nThe Romans apparently thought the Greek style of curled beard was too effeminate, and preferred a trim, well-groomed shape.\nThe use of the razor was encouraged in Rome by Lucius Tarquinius Priscus (616-578 B.C.), in an effort towards hygienic reform.\nShaving did not come into general use until about 454 B.C., when a group of Greek Sicilin barbers went to the mainland from Sicily.\nBarber shops were situated on the main streets, but were patronized only by those who could not afford to have slaves.\nThe Greeks and Romans of the ancient days mostly shaved, and the term barbarous (beard-wearing) was applied for a long period to people who were considered out of the realm of polite society.\nScipio Africanus, according to Pliny, was the first Roman to shave daily.\nPhilosophers continued to keep their beards.\nA Byzantine beard style\nThe Byzantine civilizaton favored beards and mustaches, and the hair moderately short, a combination of oriental and Roman origin, which later influenced medieval and Renaissance Europe.\nFrom the 7th to 16th centuries, the beards of Byzantium were curled, split on the center of the chin, square cut or pointed and some were extremely long.\nBy the end of the 12th century, the Greek, Roman, and oriental influences disappeared, and the cities of Florence and Venice started to set the style for the courts of Europe.\nEuropean transitions\nUntil the advent of Christianity in the 7th century, all Anglo-Saxons wore beards; members of the clergy were then compelled by law to shave.\nEnglish princes wore mustaches until William I by law (1066-87) compelled them to cut them off in accordance with the Norman fashion.\nThe Crusades were perhaps accountable for the return of beards, and for more than four centuries great diversity was allowed: beards, mustaches, and shaven faces all coexisted.\nThe Renaissance fashion in Europe included both clean-shaven faces and beards varying in shape and length.\nMany men starched their beards in the 1560s.\nIn England, Henry VIII (1509-47) brought the beard back into favor in 1535, after which beards of all shapes and lengths were worn.\nThe Vandyke style became popular for many men\nThe Flemish painter, Sir Anthony Vandyke (1599-1641) painted so many aristocrats with a pointed type of beard that it became known as the Vandyke beard. They were dressed with pomade or wax, applied with a tiny brush and comb.\nOther gadgets were used to keep the mustache and beard in shape while sleeping.\nThere were many other beard styles over the centuries a few of which are shown here\nIn 1637, Louis XIII triumphed over the Spanish influence when he amused himself by shaving his courtiers, leaving only a tiny lip beard \"a la royale\" or \"la mouche\", a custom adopted by the French and Dutch cavaliers.\nThe \"imperial\", a pointed tuft of whiskers on the chin, was named in honor of Napolean III, in the 19th century.\nIn the 19th century, long side whiskers merging into a mustache became known as the \"Franz Josef\" in honor of the emperor of Austria\nDuring the Victorian period, from about 1840 to 1870, London set the fashion for the world. Side whiskers developed a longer, more luxuriant growth and were sometimes referred to as \"mutton chops\" or \"Piccadily weepers\".\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094Information, including images, primarily from\nEncycopedia Britannica, Wlilliam Benton, Publisher; Chicago; 1968.\n",
            "60": "Get Your Whiskers on: The Right Razor Cut for Your Face\nThere is such a thing as flattering facial hair and it's amazing how a sharp razor and a little know-how can completely change your look.  Just like getting a new haircut, a new facial hair look can either flatter your best feature or bring out your worst.\nIt's important to remember 2 things:\n1. Your facial hair should offset the shape and features of your face\n\u00a0\nThe Circle Beard\nBasically this is a small beard that creates a circle shape by connecting around the mouth to the moustache. Somewhere along the line it also ended up being called a \"door knocker.\"\nThis particular look is great for square faces since the round shape helps to offset sharp jawlines and add arches.\n\u00a0\nGoatee\nSo named because it resembles the stylish beard that billy goats have been pulling off for years, the goatee is simply a very small chin beard.\n\u00a0\nBalbo\nSubtract the connections on a circle beard and you're left with a beard and a moustache each standing on their own; otherwise known as the Balbo.\nThis flattering facial hair look is great for adding some curve to square and oval faces.\n\u00a0\nVan Dyck\nYou can thank a 17th century Flemish artist for this particular look.\nIf you are trying to add curves to a square or oval face, the moustache and pointed goatee offered by the Van Dyck may be just what you need.\n\u00a0\nChinstrap\nFor those in need of lines and angles for their round or oval face the chinstrap may be the key.\nThis flattering facial hair style is a line of hair that begins at the sideburns and runs along the entire jaw.\n\u00a0\nSoul Patch\nThis 50's look has made a large scale comeback and works for any and all face shapes. The soul patch is just a small patch of hair under the lower lip in a circle, square, or triangle shape.\nTo get a flattering facial hair patch of your own, shave everything except your lower lip and then shape it until it is perfectly symmetrical.\n\u00a0\n",

            "66": "Today\u2019s Hottest Beard Styles\nBeards have reached new heights of popularity in the 2010s and there are countless beard styles men are wearing now. It is estimated that more than half of the world\u2019s adult male population has one, and the fastest growing demographic to embrace the beard is the 20-something crowd. And why wouldn\u2019t they? After all, the beard is the ultimate symbol of manliness. That is, as long as it isn\u2019t left to simply grow wild and free. A little bit of style goes a long way when it comes to beard grooming, and finding the perfect style to fit your face shape, personality and lifestyle will definitely turn all heads in your direction.\nThe differences in some beard styles is subtle; others are very distinctive. Understated, classical, contemporary, mountain-man or bold-and-edgy\u2026 it doesn\u2019t matter what effect you\u2019re looking for, there is a style that suits every face shape and taste. Let\u2019s start with a basic description of beard types and then move on to specific beard styles.\nPartial Beards\nThe term \u201c partial beard \u201d is loosely-defined, but basically refers to any facial hair growth (including the mustache) that covers part, but not all, of the skin under the lower lip, lower jaw and the area above it to approximately the cheekbone. A partial beard may or may not extend all the way to the ear area, may or may not include a mustache, and may be any length from stubble to long and beyond.\nFull Beards\nA full beard usually refers to any style/shape where the hair is left to grow and cover most or all of the space under the chin. It extends all the way to the ears on both sides of the face, and covers the face from the jawline or below all the way up to the cheekbone area. A full beard can be very short, even just a couple of days\u2019 stubble, to long and beyond. A full beard typically includes a mustache, which usually joins up with the beard hair.\nAs you can see from these explanations, hair length does not matter as much as square inches when defining a \u201cpartial\u201d versus a \u201cfull\u201d beard. The beard styles we will outline here are either partial or full, but many of them can be worn short or long or somewhere in between. \u201cStyle\u201d in many cases refers to the shape of the cut, not necessarily the length of the hair.\nThere are many beard styles and mustache styles in the world today. Below you will find 37 of the best beard styles for men.\nBeard Styles: Mustaches/Partial Beards\n1) Pencil Mustache\n\u00a0\n2) Dali Style\nThis mustache resembles a very long version of the pencil. The ends are typically twisted tightly as far toward the center of the mustache as possible.\n3) Copstash Standard Mustache Style\nThe stereotypical style for the 1970s cop, the copstash is slightly wider than the pencil, with ends that extend no further than just past the outer edges of the nose.\n4) Handlebar Mustache Style\nIn this style, the mustache hairs are left to grow longer, so that the ends extend to the lines of the eyes or even slightly beyond. The ends are then twisted into a point.\n5) Super Mario Mustache Style\nThis one is for the avid gamer or the guy who dares to be flashy. Just think Super Mario from the Nintendo series. This style is wide, thick and long, sort of an upside-down handlebar mustache without the twisted ends.\n6) Mighty El Insecto Beard Style\nThis unique and daring minimalist style features a thin, curved \u201cC\u201d shape of hair on either side of the lower chin and downward, like insect jaws.\n7) Soul Patch\nThis beard is the smallest patch of hair that can still be called a beard. Almost all facial hair is shaved, except for a small patch of hair just under the lower lip. A soul patch can be worn with or without a mustache.\n8) Zappa\nPopularized by American rock musician and guitarist Frank Zappa, this style features a box-shaped soul patch and wide, bushy mustache with ends turned downward at about the mid-eye line.\n9) Imperial/Napoleon the III Imperial\nThis style requires merely growing the soul patch a little bit longer, so that it extends to the bottom of the chin or slightly beyond, keeping the shape of the lines rounded and tidy. The Imperial can be worn with or without a mustache. The Napoleon the III Imperial is a slightly different take on the Imperial, with the chin hair extending further past the lower chin to form a long soul patch.\n10) A la Souvarov\nBarely a beard, this style features a mustache, the ends of which extend all the way to the ear line or hairline. The lines are typically curved and rounded.\n11) Franz Josef\nSimilar to the A la Souvarov, but less flashy. Lines are straight and crisp and form the shape of a \u201cW.\u201d\n12) Fu Manchu\nThis is another style that straddles the line between \u201cmustache\u201d and \u201cbeard.\u201d The mustache hairs are trimmed to form a very narrow, fairly straight line which turns downward in right angles at the ends. The beard part of the style extends downward to just past the lower part of the chin.\n13) Winnefield\nThis style looks like a cross between a Fu Manchu and a Franz Josef, except the sideburns are cut off from (not connected to) the Fu Manchu part of the style.\n14) Rap Industry Standard\nSimilar to the Fu Manchu, but even narrower. Its lines are slightly more rounded, and it typically includes a close and similarly narrow-shaven \u201cbeard\u201d which extends the length of the lower jaw line to the ear. As its name implies, it is popular with rap artists.\n15) Anchor\nThis style is so-named because the hair is shaved and trimmed into an anchor shape around the mouth/chin. The mustache forms the anchor\u2019s crossbar/stock. The soul patch forms the anchor\u2019s stock, and the hair is shaved down to the lower part of the chin and rounded off, forming the anchor\u2019s crown. The hairline moves outward to just past the ends of the mouth and shaved to points, forming the anchor\u2019s flukes.\n16) VanDyke\nThis style is similar to the anchor, but with one difference. Instead of rounding off the bottom, the hair is, instead, trimmed to form a point.\n17) Balbo\nThis style resembles an upside-down anchor, with its ends (\u201cflukes\u201d) extended outward along the lower jaw line, just past the sides of the nose. The ends are then squared off.\n18) Handlebar and Chin Puff\nThis style plays up a handlebar mustache, and features a soul patch which is grown past the lower chin and rounded off.\n19) Goatee\nThis style combines a soul patch with a patch of hair on the lower chin. Sidelines extend to just past the lips and are straight and tidy. The bottom of the goatee is rounded off.\n20) Handlebar and Goatee\nJust like the goatee, but add in a handlebar mustache.\n21) Petite Goatee\nLike its name implies, it\u2019s a narrower, more understated version of the goatee, more of a long soul patch, really. Hair is typically trimmed to a point below the lower chin.\n22) Extended Goatee\nAs its name suggests, this style is like the goatee, except for the sides. They are extended along the lower jaw line, coming to points just past the outer corners of the eyelids.\n23) Sparrow\nThink \u201cJack Sparrow\u201d in the Pirates of the Caribbean series of movies. It resembles a long goatee, divided in the middle and each half twisted into a point. The sides may be shaved like a goatee, or they may extend in a fairly narrow line along the lower jawline toward the ear.\n24) Mutton Chops\nThis style takes sideburns to a whole new level. Facial hair is left to grow from ear to lower jaw and ear to approximately a distance extending to the outer corner of the eyelids (resulting in the shape of mutton chops). The entire area below the lower lip is shaved bare. Sides are left relatively bushy. Mutton chops are typically worn with a mustache which connects to the \u201cchops\u201d at its ends.\n25) Friendly Mutton Chops\nAs the name suggests, this style resembles mutton chops, with the major difference being that the \u201cchops\u201d are worn much more closely-shaven.\n26) Hulihee\nThis style could be thought of as mutton chops on steroids. It\u2019s for the truly brave who dare to grow mutton chop hair to extreme lengths. It\u2019s a definite attention-getter.\n27) Dutch/Old Dutch Beard Styles\nAlthough this style resembles a full beard in many ways, it is still considered a partial beard because it only covers the lower half of each jaw and is worn without a mustache. The shape is similar to that of a bib connected to a soul patch.\n28) Hollywoodian\nThis style falls into that gray area between full and partial beard, and there is a little flexibility in how it can be worn and still be considered \u201cHollywoodian.\u201d As you may have guessed, it is named such for its popularity among Hollywood actors. It can best be described as taking the ends of an extended goatee and drawing them outward along the lower jaw either all the way to the sideburn area, or stopping just before it. The top of the beard is typically worn just under the lower cheekbone area. It is always worn with a mustache which connects with the beard at each end. Hair is kept short to medium-length.\n29) Chin Curtain\nThink Old Dutch, except without the soul patch. The width is also much narrower, with the top hairline being just above the lower jaw, and the bottom just below.\n30) Klingon\nThis style was made popular by the Klingon race of the Star Trek series. Its designer based it on the style that was prominent in Victorian times. It looks like a shorter, narrower version of the Dutch, with the added feature of triangular points that turn toward the corners of the mouth.\nFull Beard Styles\n31) Stubble\nThis is a classical look that can be worn either very short to approximately half and inch. The mustache ends blend into the beard.\n32) French Fork\nThis style can be achieved by growing out stubble to about two or more inches. The hair is then shaped into a long and narrow \u201cW\u201d with two points below the lower chin. Sides extend up the jawline to the ear and the mustache meets the beard at its ends.\n33) Ducktail\nIf, instead of shaping the bottom into a \u201cW\u201d you had it trimmed to a point like a \u201cV\u201d instead, you would have a ducktail.\n34) Short Boxed\nThis is the full version of the Van Dyke, with sides extending outward along the jawline and to the ear. The mustache ends are blended into the beard.\n35) Verdi\nThis style resembles a long Balbo, but with sides that extend along the lower jaw to the ear. The bottom is tapered and rounded under the middle of the lower chin.\n36) Garibaldi\nThis could be considered the \u201cfull\u201d cousin of the partial Dutch. It is similar in most every way except that it features a narrow, curved mustache with ends that blend into the beard.\n37) Bandholz Beard Style\nAKA Eric Bandholz was just a regular guy with a passion for beards. He started by competing in a beard-growing contest in 2012. Then he started a blog to unite the bearded community, and within a few years he had a beard empire on his hands, complete with a line of hipster beard products and a beard style named after him. The Bandholdz is similar to, but longer and fuller than, the short boxed and has become something of a contemporary icon for today\u2019s urban beardsmen.\nBeard Hacks for Every Face Shape\nTo look your best, you should choose a style that suits your face shape. Some beard styles just won\u2019t do for certain face shapes, while others can be tweaked a little bit to make them better-suited to your particular face shape. Keep these tips and hacks in mind.\nIf you have a round face: The idea is to try to slightly slim and elongate the lines of your face. For this reason, guys with round faces should stick with shorter beard styles, with or without mustache. It is especially important to keep sideburns neatly trimmed. You can opt for short sideburns that taper into slightly longer hair below the chin if you wish. This will help to accentuate your chin, one of the best features of the round face. If you decide to eschew the beard in favor of just a mustache, you\u2019re in luck\u2026 the round-faced guy can wear virtually any mustache style and look amazing.\nStyles to avoid if you have a round face: Chin Curtain, Dutch, Balbo, Klingon.\nIf you have a square face: You have that chiseled jawline that ladies go crazy over, so the last thing you want to do is take away from it. Your best beard styles are those that keep the hair closest to the sides and jawline trimmed short, with a little more length and fullness under the chin. Avoid trimming to a point at the chin; either round it off wide or taper and slightly round at the bottom.\nStyles to avoid if you have a square face: Hollywoodian, Klingon, Ducktail, Short Boxed, French Fork.\nIf you have an oblong/rectangular face: If your face is more square at the jawline, you\u2019ll want to soften it up a bit, while those that have a more rounded jawline may want to create the illusion of definition with squarer hairlines. With that in mind, opt for styles that are fuller at the sides and shorter at the chin, such as the short boxed.\nStyles to avoid if you have an oblong/rectangular face: Mutton chops/friendly mutton chops, Hulihee, Dutch.\nIf you have an oval face: Ovals are fortunate in that they can pull off just about any beard or mustache shape. If you opt for a trimming your beard to a point below the chin, shorter, rather than longer, hair will be better-suited to the oval-shaped face. If you want to create the illusion of a squarer, more defined jawline, go for a boxier-cut beard, such as the short boxed.\nGuides For Men To Grow Better Beards\nWelcome to Beard Growth World!

            "71": "Beards: Historical Presentation\n(the bearded races of mankind have commonly held the beard in high honor)\nPhilosophum non facit barba: \"A beard does not make a man a philosopher.\"\nBeards, Past and Present\nThe beard, in modern usage, refers to the hair grown on a man's face (chin and cheek); while \"mustache\" or \"moustache\" refers to the hair on the upper lip.\nThe bearded races of mankind have commonly held the beard in high honor. It is the sign of full manhood; the very young male or the eunuch is beardless, and the bearded woman was considered to be witch. Adam, the primal man, and the God and prophets of many faiths have been traditionally pictured with beards, as were kings and nobles and dignitaries.\nBeards have assumed all shapes and lengths, some being cultivated to lengths exceeding a man's height while Islamic people still hold the beard in high esteem.\nEgyptian-style beard example for high-ranking Egyptians\nThe earliest records indicate that the highest ranking Egyptians grew hair on their chins.\nThey frizzed, dyed or hennaed (moderate or strong reddish brown to strong brown), and sometimes plaited the beard with interwoven gold thread.\nLater, a metal, false beard or postiche, which was a sign of sovereignty, was worn by queens as well as kings.\nThis was held in place by a ribbon tied over the head and attached to a gold chin strap, a fashion existing from about 3000 B.C. To 1580 B.C.\nAn example of a Mesopotamian civilization beard style\nThe Mesopotamian civilizations (Chaldean, Babylonian, Assyrian, Median, Aramean, and ancient Persian) devoted great care to oiling and dressing their beards, using tongs or curling irons to create elaborate ringlets and frizzles, in a tiered effect\nAssyrians resorted to a black dye for eyebrows, hair, and beard; while the Persians used henna which produced an orange-red color, a style that existed from 1900 B.C.\nGold dust, gold thread, and scented yellow starch were sometimes used in the hair and the beard for festive occasions.\nIn ancient India and Turkey, the beard was allowed to grow long, a symbol of dignity and of wisdom.\nTo cut the beard was infamy among the Turks; slaves were shaved as a mark of servility.\nJewish patriarchal beard style\nPatriarchs of the tribes of Israel grew beards embellished by a hanging earlock (peyot); the peyot is still worn by some very pious orthodox Jews.\nThe Greeks and one of their beard styles\nBeards predominated among the Greeks until 323 B.C., at which time Alexanter the Great ordered his soldiers to be clean shaven, fearing that their beards would serve as handles for their enemies to grab and to hold the Greek soldier as he was killed.\nGrecian beards were frequently curled with tongs to create hanging curls.\nThe Etruscans of northern Italy (about 1000 B.C.) favored the Asian fashion of the long beard, which was eventually handed on to the Romans.\nOne of the Roman styles of beards\nThe Romans apparently thought the Greek style of curled beard was too effeminate, and preferred a trim, well-groomed shape.\nThe use of the razor was encouraged in Rome by Lucius Tarquinius Priscus (616-578 B.C.), in an effort towards hygienic reform.\nShaving did not come into general use until about 454 B.C., when a group of Greek Sicilin barbers went to the mainland from Sicily.\nBarber shops were situated on the main streets, but were patronized only by those who could not afford to have slaves.\nThe Greeks and Romans of the ancient days mostly shaved, and the term barbarous (beard-wearing) was applied for a long period to people who were considered out of the realm of polite society.\nScipio Africanus, according to Pliny, was the first Roman to shave daily.\nPhilosophers continued to keep their beards.\nA Byzantine beard style\nThe Byzantine civilizaton favored beards and mustaches, and the hair moderately short, a combination of oriental and Roman origin, which later influenced medieval and Renaissance Europe.\nFrom the 7th to 16th centuries, the beards of Byzantium were curled, split on the center of the chin, square cut or pointed and some were extremely long.\nBy the end of the 12th century, the Greek, Roman, and oriental influences disappeared, and the cities of Florence and Venice started to set the style for the courts of Europe.\nEuropean transitions\nUntil the advent of Christianity in the 7th century, all Anglo-Saxons wore beards; members of the clergy were then compelled by law to shave.\nEnglish princes wore mustaches until William I by law (1066-87) compelled them to cut them off in accordance with the Norman fashion.\nThe Crusades were perhaps accountable for the return of beards, and for more than four centuries great diversity was allowed: beards, mustaches, and shaven faces all coexisted.\nThe Renaissance fashion in Europe included both clean-shaven faces and beards varying in shape and length.\nMany men starched their beards in the 1560s.\nIn England, Henry VIII (1509-47) brought the beard back into favor in 1535, after which beards of all shapes and lengths were worn.\nThe Vandyke style became popular for many men\nThe Flemish painter, Sir Anthony Vandyke (1599-1641) painted so many aristocrats with a pointed type of beard that it became known as the Vandyke beard. They were dressed with pomade or wax, applied with a tiny brush and comb.\nOther gadgets were used to keep the mustache and beard in shape while sleeping.\nThere were many other beard styles over the centuries a few of which are shown here\nIn 1637, Louis XIII triumphed over the Spanish influence when he amused himself by shaving his courtiers, leaving only a tiny lip beard \"a la royale\" or \"la mouche\", a custom adopted by the French and Dutch cavaliers.\nThe \"imperial\", a pointed tuft of whiskers on the chin, was named in honor of Napolean III, in the 19th century.\nIn the 19th century, long side whiskers merging into a mustache became known as the \"Franz Josef\" in honor of the emperor of Austria\nDuring the Victorian period, from about 1840 to 1870, London set the fashion for the world. Side whiskers developed a longer, more luxuriant growth and were sometimes referred to as \"mutton chops\" or \"Piccadily weepers\".\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094Information, including images, primarily from\nEncycopedia Britannica, Wlilliam Benton, Publisher; Chicago; 1968.\n",
