Oh ladies! look at how douchie I am. To those who rock a chin strap beard, I am not here to insult you I am only hear to educate you. Lets face it! I dont expect everyone to have a fashion sense or be current with the newest trends because i have neither. Mugatu Chin Strap Beards on the other hand need to be addressed. They just make you look like a Douche! In Park and your still annoying people with your gayness Do not think that I am the only one with theses feeling towards your offensive facial hair, their are millions of others who will agree with me. When I see \u00a0man with a chin strap in public I instinctively \u00a0dislike you. \u00a0Even though you may very well be a nice person my first impression is that you are a Douche. Think of it this way, its like adding a loud farty exhaust to your honda civic. Im sure you get my point now. Exhibit. A. Pecker Thin Flaming Douche WHY? is correct! A pencil thin chin strap looks as though you decided to shave your face but at the last second stopped. Maybe your batteries in your electic razor ran out, maybe you were interrupted by a episode of Jersey Shore. Either way Just KEEP GOING and shave it off and you wont look like a douche anymore. Well.. if you still had spiked hair and orange skin like this guy your still a douche, but thats a hole other can of worms. Exhibit.B. Chin Memories Sympathetic Douche This one I can Sympathize with. Your fat and you miss your chin so in order to get it back you leave a strap of hair to remind you where your jaw line used to be before you were obese. You have three options here, 1- You can go on a diet to lose weight until your chin is visible again and shave your face. Or 2- You can shave your face and accept that you will never see your chin again as it is suffocated by your fat. And finally 3- You can grow a real mans beard to hide your chinlessness thus becoming that bearded fat man that everyone loves! Respectable ! If I can get one person to shave their chin strap off then I have done my job. It is up to you the readers to circulate this message in hopes that eventually the world will be Chin Strap FREE!

Wishing you the best of luck for all your blogging efforts.Exhaust TipReplyDeleteAnonymousDecember 14, 2011 at 2:13 PMWhat the fuck are you talking about? Not everyone with chin straps or chin curtains look like a douche. Chin straps and chin curtains look cool, and the \"overweight\" guy's name was \"Big Pun\". He was a great rapper, and he's dead. So it's fucked up your making fun of someone dead. Plus, chin straps are just something for guys to be happy with, believe they like it and look cool, with it. That's them, they're doing themselves, so stop being the judge of that. Who do you think you are? The fashion police? Like fuck out of here, and leave people's images alone, since not every one's gonna agree with you.ReplyDeletePatrick ZimmermannDecember 18, 2011 at 3:37 PMI see the Chin Strap Cavalry has come to the defense. I can smell the douchebaggery from here. I am sadly one of the people who tried this chin strap thing in college and realized that I looked like a tool.ReplyDeleteAnonymousDecember 27, 2011 at 9:53 PMits not that serious...its just a style of facial hair that people like and think it looks cool, besides if somebody is gonna judge you just by your facial hair, then they got some serious problems, btw that \"obese\" man you were disrespecting, is one of the greatest rappers of all time...im not going to curse you out or make a big deal, its just my two centsReplyDeleteAnonymousJanuary 4, 2012 at 9:15 PMFacial hair is just facial hair my friend..what matters is how you wear it and if YOU are happy with it..I was the guy with barely any facial hair until my mid twenties and the strap just happens to be my favorite.ReplyDeleteAnonymousJanuary 7, 2012 at 7:48 PMmy friend just made fun of a guy with a chin strap. the guy got really upset. it was funny.ReplyDeleteAnonymousMarch 5, 2012 at 3:44 AMmate Honda civics if done right are beasts. yes I have a chinstrap aswell. that's because I'm 16 and the way my facial hair naturaly grows seeing as I can't drow a full beard, idgaf what your oppinion is and if you wanna make the world chin strap free good luck buddy. the only people that judge me are people that can't grow facial hair... sounds like jeloucy to me, and last of all don't hate on larger people they are who they are and if he is a famous rapper clearly he is happy with the way he looks. if people want a chinstrap let the baby have it's bottle..ReplyDeleteAnonymousMarch 5, 2012 at 6:05 PMI'm considering how I'm going to style my beard. I wanted to try the chin strap, the mutton chops, or the chin curtain beard. I used to just do the full beard until I seen how bad my facial hair looks (like pubic hair on my face), and how sparse it is in places (patchy on my cheeks), and so a full beard for me looks embarrassing. Right now, I'm leaning towards a chin-strap-goatee thing. I once tried a crescent-shaped goatee that sat right under my chin. But I haven't stopped to reconsider these ideas, and wondered if, instead of adding personality, or character, to my look, I might come off looking like a tool, or a douche, like the Jersey Shore reject pictured above (the only actual legitimate douche featured on this blog [except maybe for the blogger]). I've seen some guys with this type of beard that struck me as tools, and so I worried about the association I might have with them if I adopted this kind of beard style. Although I'd try to put my own stamp on it, and make it look unique. Overall, I don't think it looks so bad, and it depends on the guy.Really .... here's the only sensible verdict coming from the only sensible person on this page: it doesn't fucking matter. I believe in the freedom of the individual. You can dress or adorn yourself in ANY WAY YOU WANT. I don't care if I don't like it. I don't care if I wouldn't do the same thing. It all depends on what YOU want to do, and fuck all with the rest. You might not have a style I like. So the hell what? Usually, I'll be cool about it, and not rip on you for it. I'm pretty accepting, and open-minded - pretty much down with however you want to be, even if I don't like you. It's a matter of the individual's choice, no matter how freakish; and I'm not about to ostracize you for it like a vicious, feeble-minded, elementary school kid, who feels repulsion at people's differences, and is insecure and confused about their place in the world, and has to open their foolish little mouths at any person who sticks out. You don't like the chin strap? Then don't wear it.Some of this blog was actually funny, and written decently. Mostly it oozed the insecurity, sexual frustration, and male-cattiness of yet another of these sad, pathetic, angry Internet men with no sense of fashion (admitted), style, what women want, what to do with women, or what to do with their lives. That was just too thickly palpable here, and I'd really rather not sit in the light of judgment from a much lesser man.ReplyDeleteAnonymousMarch 28, 2012 at 11:13 AMtwo words for everyone. Asuma Sarutobi. I agree i think pencil chin straps are kind of ridiculous just because i'd never care that much about how i look to be so diligent everyday. but chin strap beards are sweet but for some reason noone really does them, chin strap beards are just like managed beards, not facial pedecuresReplyDeleteAnonymousMarch 28, 2012 at 11:31 AMthis might help explain the chin strap better http://www.cracked.com/funny-3782-chin-strap-beards/ReplyDeleteAnonymousMarch 30, 2012 at 4:22 PMI'm not skinny, but im not \"obese\" eather... and i ROCK THE HELL OUT OF A BEARD AND A CHIN STRAP!!!!

I wear my pencil line chin strap- that was faster to shape than shaving my jaw- with pride while I'm at the club with the hottest chick in there, while your ok chick and the guy next to you's chick is sweating my nuts.

Also all I have got is compliments on my chinstrap. Only one guy made a negative comment and he can't even grow facial hair so therefore it doesn't matter.ReplyDeleteAnonymousAugust 17, 2013 at 3:29 PM Douchebags insult and talk shit about people, the blogger is insulting and talking shit about people, the blogger is a douchebag.

You know, those men that talk big about all the gash they are clocking at the clubs are the dickbeaters that live in their parents house watching free internet porn, and popping zits alone on Friday and Saturday nights.ReplyDeleteAnonymousFebruary 19, 2014 at 9:12 AMDo not think that I am the only one with \"these\" feelings towards your offensive use of the English language. \"There\" are millions of others who will agree with me. When I see man who doesn't understand the difference between \"there\" and \"their\" and still posts a written blog in public, I instinctively dislike you. Even though you may very well be a nice person my first impression is that you are an ignorant tool bag who thinks of himself as a writer of some sort, yet would fail elementary school English class.ReplyDeleteClip&StoreSeptember 5, 2015 at 2:28 PMGirls love the Douchebag look so this just convinced me even more that I should thin my chin strap a little more ReplyDeleteClip&StoreSeptember 5, 2015 at 2:41 PMGirls love the Douchebag look so this just convinced me even more that I should thin my chin strap a little more ReplyDeleteRepliesAnonymousJune 10, 2016 at 10:59 AMAmenDeleteReplyRamiDecember 3, 2015 at 2:38 AMThis is a great inspiring article.I am pretty much pleased with your good work.You put really very helpful information.

Get used to it. amagazinebloguk / February 12, 2014 When the 90s became the 00s and mass-produced urban culture was taking over, I\u2019ll bet anyone\u2019s vision of the future assumed that it would be technology that shaped the way we live and dress, combining it all in a fusion of sparkling modernity. In fact, the opposite seems to have occurred. The manufacture and purchase of material goods has returned its focus to the quality of the materials from which it\u2019s made, over what gimmicks and tricks the product can perform. In clothing, natural fibres, traditional tailoring and classic cuts have overtaken that desire to look modern, bringing about the rise of the hipster, the boom of vintage and the return of the beard. Aside from the odd goatee and some designer stubble, facial hair had been strikingly absent from men\u2019s fashion for a whole generation. The thought of coiffed and manicured facial hair conjured images of Bavarian waxed moustaches, or Edwardian English gentlemen bumbling about on a croquet-lawn. But in the mass media age, when we are all encouraged to craft our own niche in what we consume, our quirks are celebrated and fashion is dictated by the consumer. The human body has become as individual as the clothing, with hairstyles, tattoos and facial hair the basis of the look, not just an addition to it. When John Lewis embraced hobo chic with their fully bearded male model Johnny Harrington early last year, the beard had well and truly arrived. From chinstraps to handlebars, from mutton chops to a full shenandoah, the beard has become part of a thoroughly twenty-first century phenomenon; \u2018old\u2019 is the new \u2018new\u2019. Grandpa jumpers, battered leather shoes, satchels and plaid, men are dressed in new versions of what could be thrift, but with their faces and heads snipped and clipped and perfectly neat, juxtaposed against patterns and rough hewn fabrics. Gone are the days of wet-look spiky hair and baby-faced boys-next-door. Even the chavs have embraced the fuzz. The beard has gone fully global. The artsy alternative scenes in cities all over the world have crept out into the mainstream; individuality is the new inviolable trend. People, their homes and the media they consume have diversified to the point of complete assimilation and oddities and peculiarities, that might have been condemned to mere freakshows before, have become the norm. The full beard is definitely one of the more peculiar male fashions to find its way back to the fore, but in a world in which masculinity is losing itself in the metrosexual grooming of the twenty-first century, what can assert your manhood more than simply growing a beard? Women can\u2019t do that, can they? No matter how it\u2019s cut, a beard will always be manly. Think about that the next time you shave. By Ben Turner for A-Magazine.

What Haircuts Look Good with a Beard? There\u2019s no denying that beards are still in style in 2015 and they look here to stay. Still, while beards will definitely add a touch of rugged sexiness to many looks and styles, it takes a special kind of man to pull off the beard look properly. Of course, not every man is even able to grow a decent beard, but for those that can, you\u2019ll need to consider much more than just which beard style\u00a0(or mustache, goatee, full beard\u00a0or other facial hair style) you want. Looking smart, sexy and stylish with a beard is about more than just knowing how to\u00a0grow, maintain, and trim a good beard, as you\u2019ll also want to pair it with the right hairstyle if you want to truly look your best. If you\u2019re like most men, you\u2019ve probably been wondering what kind of haircut goes good with a beard\u2014so to help you out, we\u2019ve done a bit of research and are here to present some of the best haircuts for beards. If there\u2019s one bit of wisdom we wish to impart to our fellow bearded fellows out there, it\u2019s that looking stylish requires a bit of time and thought. Believe us when we say that the haircut actually matters as much as the beard itself in determining how you\u2019ll look, as there are some hairstyles that work perfectly with some beards, while there are easily as many or more that can quickly ruin the look\u2014no matter how great of a beard you can grow. Know the Shape of Your Face In our article on the best beard styles, we previously discussed the importance of matching the style of your beard to the shape of your face (e.g. best beard styles for round faces). Still, the shape of your face isn\u2019t just important when it comes to choosing a beard style, as the shape of the face will also play a role in what kind of haircut goes good with a beard. Like with beards, men with a shorter, longer or rounder face should be careful to choose a haircut that helps to accentuate their other features instead of doing the opposite. For instance, men with short or rounder faces usually gain a huge benefit from keeping the sides of their hair short, as otherwise they risk their face looking rounder or fatter. On the other hand, men with longer faces are usually better off avoiding a hairstyle that\u2019s shorter on the sides and longer on the top, as this type of hairstyle tends to make an already long face look that much longer. Of course, your choice of hairstyle will also depend in large part on what sort of style or look you\u2019re going for\u2014be it more professional, wild, rugged or full on mountain man. Best Hairstyles for Beards Like choosing a beard style, determining what kind of haircut goes good with a beard is mostly a matter of personal preference. That being said, there are at least a few hairstyles that are currently popular and tend to look good on most bearded men. The Undercut Photo Credit hairstyleonpoint.com The undercut is an incredibly popular style amongst younger men with big beards, especially if they don\u2019t have too long or skinny of a face. The classic undercut involves keeping the sides closely trimmed short, while the hair on top of the head stays quite a bit longer. With the top, you have the choice of using pomade or gel to keep it slicked back in place or just letting it lay in a more natural way. Either way, you\u2019ll want to make sure the barber fades the sides near the top and you may want to consider having the barber shave in a part, as it looks good and makes it easier to keep it properly styled on your own. There\u2019s actually many different ways to wear the undercut, but most of them require a bit of help from hair products, as you definitely want to avoid letting the top hair hang down on your forehead. The biggest thing about the undercut is that the hair on top hangs slightly down past the fade sides, which then blend in perfectly with the beard. Another benefit of the undercut (or any hairstyle with short sides) is that it wearing it with a beard that\u2019s slightly longer can help make the beard look much thicker and fuller. Recommended Product: Smooth Viking Pomade\u00a0Medium Hold and High Shine Pompadour The pompadour is one of those styles that really seems to come and go, but right now it is definitely in style. In truth, there really isn\u2019t a huge difference between the pompadour and some versions of the undercut, but in most cases the pompadour requires you to keep the hair on top of the head quite a bit longer. With a true pompadour, the hair on top of the head should ideally be around 6 inches and kept slicked back with product. To achieve the real pompadour effect, you\u2019ll need to use pomade, a blow dryer and a comb to achieve the trademark \u201cup\u201d look at the front. Recommended Product: Smooth Viking Pomade Strong\u00a0Hold and High Shine Classic Square Crop Photo Credit: menstylefashion.com A timeless favorite that works well on nearly any man, no matter the shape of their face or the look of their beard. The classic square crop is definitely one of the most basic haircuts out there, but also one of the most versatile. With this style, both the sides and the top are all left to the same somewhat shortish length (the actual length is up to you, but be aware there\u2019s a fine line between too short or too long\u2014both of which can ruin you\u2019re carefully crafted style. While the classic square cut looks good with many different facial hair styles, it\u2019s especially popular amongst men with full beards, as it can help add a more professional look to that rugged, manly style. Another reason we like this style is that it\u2019s incredibly versatile and can be worn in a number of ways, from more messy to coiffed, perfectly styled and everything in between. Recommended Product: Baxter of California Clay Pomade Peaked Cut Photo Credit: grooming.wahl.com Not to be confused with the awful faux-hawk (which no self-respecting man above the age of 25 should be wearing), the peaked cut was incredibly popular in the 90s and is suddenly making a comeback. This style is quite similar to the classic square cut, except that the sides are usually faded a bit more and the front, top part is kept slightly longer to allow for styling. Still, that\u2019s the thing with this cut, as it looks good for those who know how to style it, it also takes a bit of work to pull it off, as you\u2019ll need to add a bit of volume to that little front part to work it properly. Recommended Product: TIGI Bed Head B for Men Matte Separation Workable Wax Tousled Long Locks Photo Credit: pinuppickspenup.com While there are some who would argue that longer hair on guys is quickly going back out of fashion, pairing slightly messy, even slightly longer locks with a beard can also scream manliness and has a certain rebellious appeal. However, the biggest key here is to still keep it short enough that you don\u2019t look like a slob. While having slightly longer, tousled hair is supposed to make it seem like you don\u2019t care about your looks as much, actually not caring about your looks and letting your hair get too long is definitely something you want to avoid. A good rule of thumb is to keep the hair on your forehead trimmed slightly shorter (or else pulled back to the sides) and by all means, don\u2019t let your hair get long enough that it touches your shoulders. Anything more than two or so inches past the earlobes is starting to push it and can take what should be a manly look and turn it into something much more feminine. At the end of the day, deciding what haircut goes good with a beard can actually be quite tricky, which is why we would usually recommend to choose a hairstyle that you like and then adapt the beard to it, rather than vice versa. While you can always change up your beard styles to see what looks best, the fact that the hair on your head grows slower than that on your face means you\u2019ll be forced to live with the mistake much longer should you choose a hairstyle you\u2019re not happy with.

Search Main menu Skip to primary content Skip to secondary content HomeAbout Commenting The Clouds Tag Archives: Adam Levine Historical 21st Century Pop\u00a0Artists Posted on May 8, 2016 by Alee 4 With Michael Jackson gone and Prince\u2019s recent passing, some are wondering if the days of great pop music are now history. Who can live up to the prolific musical geniuses of the late 20th century? It remains to be seen but a few artists\u00a0show promise. 1. Justin Timberlake: Smooth moves, smooth voice, original songs and videos. \u00a0Will Justin prove that he is the most iconic male pop artist post-MJ? 2. Britney Spears: Britney is already an icon but if today\u2019s \u201cQueen of Pop\u201d can commit to making music for the long haul, there is no stopping her. 3. Lady Gaga: This line from \u2018Applause\u2019 says it all, \u201cPop culture was in art, now art\u2019s in pop culture, in me.\u201d 4. Bruno Mars: Has long since been compared to musical giants of earlier periods. Being a skilled vocalist, performer, and musician, he defines the word \u201cartist\u201d. 5. Adam Levine: With his entrance as front man of Maroon 5, he made Southern California rock-pop look easy. He has the originality, personality, and love of the art to make a name for himself as a 21st century pop icon. Which of today\u2019s artists do you think will become the pop icons of tomorrow? Honorable Mention: Katy Perry, Taylor Swift, Rihanna Posted in Music | Tagged Adam Levine, Mainstream Music | 4 Replies Adam Levine Posted on December 2, 2010 by Alee 8 Adam Levine is an American singer, guitarist, and songwriter. He is the lead singer of Grammy Award-winning band Maroon 5. Adam was born to Jewish parents in Los Angeles, California. He showed a strong love of music at a young age, learning to play the guitar and\u00a0 performing on stage at twelve years old. As a teenager at the Brentwood School, a private day school in LA, he was awkward: he says of his teen years, \u201cI was gross, My hair was long and really ratty\u2026[I wore] huge, oversize flannels that didn\u2019t fit [and I had] a goatee.\u201d He met future band mates Jesse Carmichael, Mickey Madden, and Ryan Dusick at a performing arts camp while he was in junior high school. They formed the band Kara\u2019s Flowers and released one album in 1997 \u2014 The Fourth World. They later reformed in 2001 as Maroon 5. Maroon 5\u2019s debut album Songs About Jane was based on lyrics written about his break-up with a former girlfriend. The second single from the album, \u201cThis Love\u201d, won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance in 2005. Their second album It Won\u2019t Be Soon Before Long was released in 2007 to similar success. Their latest release Hands All Over is described as \u201ca killer hybrid of rock, pop, funk and R&B.\u201d Adam has had much success as a solo artist, working with artists such as Kanye West, Alicia Keys, and Slash (Guns N\u2019 Roses/Velvet Revolver). He has stated that he plans to leave Maroon 5\u00a0in the near future. Adam is ambidextrous \u2014 he writes with his left hand, but uses his right hand for almost everything else. He has been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), a disorder characterized by hyperactivity and difficulty with attention. He says he \u201cloves women\u201d and plans on getting married, despite high divorce rates and his own parents divorce when he was seven. He has been romantically linked to several celebrities, but his current girlfriend of nearly a year is Russian model Anne Vyalitsyna. Adam lives in Hollywood Hills with his close friend, Korean-American writer and producer Gene Hong. Posted in Biographies, Music Artists | Tagged Adam Levine, Adam Levine Biography, Male Singers, Maroon 5 | 8 Replies Best Male Vocalists of the Decade\u00a0(2000-2010) Posted on November 17, 2010 by Alee 29 My top ten list of the best male singers who released an album in the past decade.\u00a0The list is based on vocals and vocal range, principally. Feel free to make any suggestions. 1. Chris Daughtry is an American singer, songwriter, and lead vocalist of the rock band Daughtry. He was finished fourth on the fifth season of American Idol. Chris Daughtry is an amazing artist with a voice I could listen to for days. Every song he touches turns to gold. 2. Usher is an American R&B and pop singer. Billboard magazine ranked Usher the number one Hot 100 artist of the decade, with his 2004 album Confessions ranking as the top solo album. He is a wonderful entertainer and great vocalist; a hit-making machine. 3. Chad Kroeger (Nickelback) is a Canadian singer, songwriter, and guitarist. He is the lead vocalist of the rock band Nickelback and has co-written songs for Daughtry, Tim McGraw, and Carlos Santana. Chad Kroeger has a classic voice which fits with all types of songs, from rock to country. 4. Jason Wade (Lifehouse) is an American singer, songwriter, and guitarist of the alternative band Lifehouse. Jason Wade\u2019s soothing, baritone vocals are priceless, but don\u2019t look like they should be coming from him with his boyish good looks. 5. Rob Thomas is an American singer, songwriter, and lead vocalist of the rock band Matchbox Twenty. He collaborated with Carlos Santana on the multi-Grammy winning hit \u201cSmooth\u201d. Rob Thomas\u2019 has an unforgettable raspy, dynamic voice. 6. Maxwell is an American soul and R&B artist. His first album in almost a decade, BLACKsummers\u2019night, won the 2010 Grammy for Best R&B Album. \u201cFistful of Tears\u201d by Maxwell is one of the best songs I\u2019ve ever heard: sincere and soulful. 7. Backstreet Boys are an American pop group. The group is the best-selling boy band of all time, beating out the Jackson 5, with over 130 million albums sold worldwide. The Backstreet Boys are, of course, five people instead of one person, but I couldn\u2019t choose a favorite. They are one of the rare groups in which all members contribute equally to their success. 8. James Morrison is an English singer, songwriter, and guitarist. His first album Undiscovered, released in 2006, topped charts in the UK. \u201cThe Pieces Don\u2019t Fit Anymore\u201d is my favorite song by James Morrison, and one of my favorite songs of all time. 9. Omarion is an American singer, songwriter, and actor. He was the lead singer of former R&B group B2K. Omarion\u00a0was doing much better\u00a0without B2K, but has dropped as of late. Hopefully he\u2019ll\u00a0come\u00a0back with his usual intensity in the coming years. 10. Ginuwine is an American singer, dancer, and sex symbol. Ginuwine was at his height in the \u201990s, but his 2002 hit \u201cStingy\u201d and strong vocals landed him a place on this list. Honorable Mention (in alphabetical order by first name): Adam Levine, Anthony Kiedis\u00a0(Red Hot Chili Peppers), Brad Arnold (3 Doors Down), Chris Brown, Chris Martin (Coldplay), Isaac Slade (The Fray), Jason Mraz, Joe, Justin Timberlake, Mario Winans, Sisqo, Sting See also: James Morrison \u2013 You Give Me Something Mainstream Music is Bad Music?

January 5, 2016 | Fashion, Health & Fitness, Lifestyle | 0 Comments By Dustin Shrader Even if you\u2019re not a talker, your facial hair says a lot about who you are without ever having to utter a word. They say clothes make the man, but where does facial hair come into play? Turns out, there\u2019s a smorgasbord of versatility for gay boys willing to explore \u2013 whether you prefer a smooth crisp look, a trimmed stache, or even a full-on Grizzly Adams. Some gay men go so far as to put their facial hair where their personality isn\u2019t. Now, don\u2019t be that guy, but with options galore, we look at what a chosen style can add to your personal expression. And the good news is that you can wipe the slate clean and say something different next time. Beard You have a lot of profound confidence but it\u2019s relatively quiet and subtle. Although you appreciate the beautiful imagery of life, you sir, are no peacock. Showing off isn\u2019t your thing. Mustache Ah, the nostalgic. You long for the glory days. You put all your energy into a few projects but can\u2019t really focus on more than one thing. Dom from Looking is your spirit animal. Goatee The goatee screams refinement, yet you struggle with long-term commitment. If presented with making a decision, you will find a way to have the best of both worlds without committing to one or the other permanently. A relationship with you may work for now, but not forever. Scruff (5 o\u2019clock shadow) A hardworking man. You vie for success and do what it takes without getting wrapped up in superficiality of appearance. But when all the work is done, you\u2019re not afraid to hit the town, looking fly, ready to party the night away. Clean shaven You like neatness and order. Whether or not you have a chiseled jawline that only a smooth face can accentuate perfectly, take note from the Scruffy boy and don\u2019t take yourself too seriously. Mountain Man (Long and scraggly) A wild child who just don\u2019t give a fuck. Full of energy, you have a taste for all things natural. Inclined toward comfort, you keep a level head for whatever life throws your way. Keep it hanging loose, man. Chinstrap Preferred by twinks and athletes, you are simply an enigma. People may question your motives, but you don\u2019t care. A man of mystery doesn\u2019t answer to anyone but himself. Unexplainable, you do you and that is all that matters. Van Dyke You\u2019re unconventional with a touch of weirdness that is undeniably sexy.\u00a0 A bit of a hipster, you\u2019re a guy who loves a good local craft or checking out the latest indie group at the local watering hole. Mutton Chops OK, MC. You\u2019re a man\u2019s man. A downright Hugh Jackamn Wolverine wannabe. You\u2019re big, you\u2019re bad, you love your bike. It is your world and we are just living in it, baby. Soul Patch No, just no. This isn\u2019t the \u201890s, and you\u2019re not Apollo Ono or Jackie Chan. Hell, you\u2019re not even JLo\u2019s boy toy Casper Smart. Kiss the soul goodbye. Leave a comment Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

But seriously, middle-aged Vinny Barbarino has tried and done everything to \u201cchange his image\u201d for a Hollywood and general public that has been unsympathetic. It seems that ever since John went balls-out and took on dreadlocks for turn-of-the-century monstrosity that was Battlefield Earth, that he\u2019s never really revived his career. Nearly every film he\u2019s been in has been mediocre. Enough to get work, yes, but enough to get respect? Eh. So I\u2019ve poured through the best and worst of Johnny T in honor of the next film that appears to continue the cycle of hair \u2014 which is now none \u2014\u00a0From Paris with Love. I\u2019m going through Travolta\u2019s most notable films by decade, leaving out only a few for time\u2019s sake. He tends to do well every other decade, so will that trend continue in the actor\u2019 fifth decade of work? Is there a place for him anymore? Who knows \u2026 1970s Saturday Night Fever (1977) \u2013 HIT After premiering on television\u2019s Welcome Back, Kotter in 1975, Travolta became a sensation after the release of the disco movie of all time, Saturday Night Fever. Although from what I remember half of this movie is Travolta swaggering down the sidewalk to disco music, he became a teen heartthrob on a massive scale after this one. A disco-dancing movie is a peculiar way to skyrocket a career, so playing cinema psychologist, you might be able to look at that today and nod your head a bit. \u2014 Grease (1978) \u2013 HIT With a background in musical comedy and having his big break in the stage version of this show at the age of 18, where else is a better fit for a teen idol than \u201cHigh School Musical 1950.\u201d It only helped that Grease went on to become the highest-grossing movie musical of all time, a record that still stands once you negate the classic Disney musicals. Adjust for inflation and it\u2019s one of the all-time biggest movies. No. 26, actually. \u2014 1980s Staying Alive (1983) \u2013 MISS On the list off all-time bad movie choices, agreeing to a sequel to your disco film after disco was out of style (and disco did not go lightly) has to be up there. Add to that Sylvester Stallone as the director and the premise being about your disco character trying to make it on Broadway and you have an awful career move. This was the high watermark of a 10-year span where John disappeared. \u2014 Look Who\u2019s Talking (1989) \u2013 HIT It might not have been great, but this romantic comedy with Travolta, Kirstie Alley and a baby that talks like Bruce Willis was a big hit in 1989 and it pushed John toward his big comeback in the \u201990s (albeit in the \u201990s it wasn\u2019t for comedy). The premise was cute enough and people dug it to the tune of nearly $300 million worldwide. \u2014 1990s Pulp Fiction (1994) \u2013 HIT Ah, finally. The movie that actually made John Travolta\u2019s career. The number of films he got off playing Vince Vega lasted him at least through the rest of the decade and that was a lot of parts. He would\u2019ve quite likley spiraled into romantic comedy oblivion without help from Quentin Tarantino. As a hit man who earned our sympathies, John was sharp. He earned his second (and most recent, naturally) Oscar nomination for the role. Sadly, it didn\u2019t get much better than that. \u2014 Michael (1996) \u2013 MISS Travolta followed up \u201cFiction\u201d with a similar role as Chili Palmer in showbiz comedy Get Shorty, another solid film, but in 1996 he tried on telekinesis in Phenomenon and wings in Nora Ephron\u2019s\u00a0Michael. I saw parts of this movie on TV a few months back and the glued on feathers are not the only thing tacky about the film. Here we see John also going with the mistake of long hair again. Perhaps this was the beginning of the hair motif that\u2019s butchered Travolta\u2019s career. \u2014 Face/Off (1997) \u2013 HIT Travolta\u2019s second action thriller under the direction of John Woo, \u00a0Face/Off has a special place in my heart being one of the first R-rated films my parents ever let me see. Nic Cage and John Travolta wearing each others faces and that chick jabbing a butterfly knife into his leg? That\u2019s awesome when you\u2019re 10 or 11. That aside, this was actually one of Travolta\u2019s better action movies. \u2014 A Civil Acton (1998) \u2013 HIT We watched part of this movie in math class one year in high school, I have no friggin\u2019 idea why. This, along with 1999\u2019s The General\u2019s Daughter was the last piece of good press Travolta ever got for doing a drama and really one of his last dramas. He takes on the role of an attorney fighting for the parents of children wanting to sue their water supplier for dumping toxic waste into the water supply. \u2014 2000s Battlefield Earth (2000) \u2013 MISS So it begins. This movie keeps popping up as one of the worst films of all-time, not just a terrible appearance from John Travolta in dreadlocks. I never saw it, though like many people at the time, I thought it looked cool given the current state of special effects. Of course I had no idea that this was a Scientology film (it\u2019s based on the novel by the religion\u2019s founder, L. Ron Hubbard) in addition to all the other terrible things it apparently is. People in 2099 will probably cite this as one of the worst movies of the century. \u2014 Swordfish (2001) \u2013 HIT Although not a great movie, Swordfish was successful as a run-of-the-mill hacker thriller. This was the movie that rose to fame on Halle Berry\u2019s tits. That\u2019s all there is to say. \u2014 Be Cool (2005) \u2013 MISS Get Shorty was a decent movie, but there was no reason to revisit Chili Palmer 10 years later, where he\u2019s moved on from trying to make movies to making it in the music business. Though a different cast, Travolta\u2019s days as a star vehicle in such a way were over. \u2014 Wild Hogs (2007) \u2013 MISS Wild Hogs was a surprised financial success, but what Travolta might no have realized was the joke was on him as well as his other middle-aged biker buddies. Everyone knows there\u2019s a difference between being laughed at and with: the old balls biker gang is an example of the former. Since this movie, Travolta has done nothing but garner poor reviews. Even the decent Hairspray had a rotten spot with Travolta\u2019s cross-dressing turn as Edna Turnblad. \u2014 The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 (2009) \u2013 MISS The most recent of my Travolta film experiences and the first of the bizarre facial hair choices. A tattooed trash-talking criminal, Travolta was atrocious and completely detestable. Villains aren\u2019t supposed to be liked, but they\u2019re at least supposed to earn respect for being dastardly. Travolta earns no such credit. He sucks. Period. Will a fully shaved head and a filled-out goatee change his luck? What do you think?

I knew Jason Priestley had been bearded off and on but it is great to see the pics side by side like that. I think he can really pull off various styles. I saw some pictures of him in a local magazine here sporting the full beard (like the latter pics) but he had shaped it more and trimmed a proper neckline. With those adjustments it really looked much more suited to him.

Posted by JBT Among the latest news to come out of Hollywood is that Charlize Theron has shorn her beautiful blonde locks for the upcoming film Mad Max: Fury Road.\u00a0 Anne Hathaway made news recently too for losing her hair for Les Miserables.\u00a0 They join a long list of actors who have sacrificed their hair for their art.\u00a0 If the role demands it, stars seem willing to go under the razor.\u00a0 Some have opted not to lose their locks, but rather to wear bald caps and make-up (like Cameron Diaz in My Sister\u2019s Keeper.) \u00a0If going bald means enhancing the believability and quality of a performance, there appear to be few qualms about doing it in Hollywood.\u00a0 Sometimes getting into character means a certain level of physical modification.\u00a0 Whether playing a cancer patient, a badass villain or a badass chick, several actors have gone the distance and embraced baldness for film.\u00a0 Here are a few notable baldies: Natalie Portman \u2013 V for Vendetta Portman lost her hair to play ally to a freedom fighter in a futuristic dystopian society. Joseph Gordon-Levitt \u2013 50/50 Gordon-Levitt took it all off \u2013 his hair, that is \u2013 to play a radio journalist who is diagnosed with a rare cancer in his spine and must undergo chemotherapy. Demi Moore \u2013 G.I. Jane Moore shaved off her own long locks while playing Jordan O\u2019Neill, the first woman to undergo training in the U.S. Navy Seals. Kevin Spacey \u2013 Seven Spacey\u2019s baldness enhanced the creepy, sadistic and diabolical nature of the serial killer he portrayed. Sigourney Weaver \u2013 Alien 3 Weaver went bald for the third installment of the popular sci-fi series in which Ripley crash lands on a planet inhabited by hardened convicts with an alien stowaway in tow. John Travolta \u2013 From Paris with Love Travolta played a bald-headed, goatee-wearing American CIA special agent sent to Paris on a mysterious mission. Robin Tunney \u2013 Empire Records Tunney epitomized 90s grunge when she shaved her head to portray a hostile, antisocial and apathetic music store employee. Cate Blanchett, Heaven Blanchett was shorn to play a vengeful wife who takes the law into her own hands by planting a bomb to kill a drug dealer after her husband falls victim to a drug overdose. Who wore bald best?\u00a0 Are there other notable actors who sacrificed their hair for a role?\u00a0 Let us know in the comments section.

Very cool.DeleteReplyCandice Frederick2:14 pmI'm gonna go with Kevin Spacey and Sigourney Weaver.ReplyDeleteRepliesJBT10:33 pmGood picks. Spacey was simply cringe-inducing in 'Seven' and Sigourney was a bad-ass chick.

Agreeing to lose all of your hair for a role shows some serious dedication.DeleteReplyAlex Withrow11:14 amI think I'm going to have to go with Moore here. I love that her character did it as an act of defiance, but also for acceptance. Plus, she owned the hell out of it. Really interesting (and humorous) write up.ReplyDeleteRepliesJBT8:05 amMoore is a great pick for exactly the reasons that you mention. What shaving her head stood for in the film makes it all the more meaningful and she DID own the hell out of it. Boy, was she badass holding her own with all the men.Thanks - I'm glad you enjoyed the post!DeleteReplyChip Lary6:26 pmWell, the early teens boy I was at the time would say it was Persis Khambatta in Star Trek: The Motion Picture. I had never thought I would find a bald woman sexy, but she was. I found a pic here that shows her with and without hair: http://www.lozzipr.com/persis.htmlOn a sad note, in confirming the spelling of her name on IMDB I found out that she died in 1998 at the age of 49 from a heart attack.ReplyDeleteRepliesJBT8:09 amI'm glad you mentioned Persis Khambatta for this list. And thanks for providing a link to her picture. She looked great bald. Some women can really pull it off and she was one of them.Oh, that is sad. She was so young.DeleteReplyAdd commentLoad more...

But goatee styles require maintenance so get ready to put your shaving skills to the test. \u00a0You will need a beard trimmer and you have to decide which goatee shape to go for but other than that you are good to go. 1.\u00a0Robert Pattinson Goatee Style It looks like Robert Pattinson gave in to the goatee style look.

Will Smith\u2019s Grey Goatee Style Will Smith is one trendy actor that is also famous for his inspired looks. His grey goatee has been trimmed to perfection. 7. Cool Mustache Goatee The classic look for goatees usually implies having a moustache and a beard.

So feel free to try out different looks with or without a mustache, depending on your face type. 8. The Laid Back Look More and more hipsters are into goatee coloring to look older.

Black Men Goatee Styling Black mens goatee styles lean more towards an audacious look; a daring goatee trim that can be spotted from miles away. 15.

Goatee and mustache styles have been around for quite some time and many actors have decided to revive this look because it is associated with manliness. 21. Mustache and Goatee Style Styling a goatee can be tricky at times; this is why you should go to a barber\u2019s salon first and go for what the stylist recommends you in terms of length, shape and hair care. You should know that the best goatee beard styles for men are the ones that come with a fabulous mustache. 22. Bradley Cooper\u2019s Take on Goatees Short goatee styles can easily pass as the five o\u2019clock shadow.

Fawad Khan\u2019s goatee is close to perfection. 25. Wide Goatee Types Stylists recommend men with long, oval shaped faces to go for any goatee style because their facial features are more flattered this way. 26. Beards Are In Beards have been trending for years now. Add a stylish goatee and you can nail one inspired look. 27.

Undercuts and Goatees The hairstyle is as important as the goatee itself so if you plan on drawing people\u2019s attention, go for an undercut to match a thick goatee. 34. David Beckham, the Trendsetter Everybody perceives David Beckham as a fashion icon and he certainly deserves this title. His type of goatee is recommended for guys with round faces. 35. Modern Goatee Style Most goatee styles for men are a modern interpretation of the old ones.

Thick Goatee There are plenty of goatee styles for older men. Most of them are low-maintenance and require regular trimming but that\u2019s about it. 37. Goatee without Mustache Some men prefer a goatee without a mustache and the look goes well with casual fashion styles best. 38. The Long, Manly Goatee This kind of goatee beard style requires more maintenance but it is worth the trouble nevertheless. 39.

They want their soul patch back By Patrick Huguenin February 16, 2017 Getty Images Every decade has its style, whether it\u2019s top hats and monocles or parachute pants and Airwalks. Facial hair is no different. Every mutton chop, soul patch, and handlebar mustache belongs to its own special time\u2014and just because these guys belong in the modern decade doesn\u2019t mean their beards do. Here are 13 modern men with decade-specific facial fuzz. Where does yours belong?

In fact, Abe Lincoln was the first bearded president. With him came the \u201cchin curtain,\u201d a beard that starts just above your jaw line and goes straight down. Abe made his extra chin-y by wearing it without a mustache, and to be perfectly honest, no one has pulled it off since. 1870: Sensational Sideburns 2/13 Getty Images 1870: Sensational Sideburns The face-flanking beasts known as sideburns didn\u2019t get their name until the spectacularly scruffy Civil War general Ambrose Burnside rose to fame. His cottony white cheek fluff grew to magnificent length and connected over his lip, leaving his chin bare. It\u2019s a look that makes a man look like a zany inventor\u2014or a meme. 1880/90: The Full Bush 3/13 Getty Images 1880/90: The Full Bush Thanks to history's two hairiest presidents\u2014Rutherford Hayes and, briefly, James Garfield\u2014the last part of the century was a beard-growin' free-for-all. In this bushy period, long before the invention of the electric clipper, facial hair was allowed to be free. There is a strong possibility that your facial hair right now is nostalgic for this era. 1900/10: The Handlebar Mustache 4/13 Getty Images 1900/10: The Handlebar Mustache Contrary to hipster belief, the handlebar mustache was invented at the turn of the century\u2014not in an artist\u2019s Williamsburg garage circa 2009. President Taft brought the art of tip-twirling to the White House, where it left such an impression that another mustache hasn\u2019t inhabited the Oval Office since. 1920: The Distinguished Uncle 5/13 Getty Images 1920: The Distinguished Uncle While the young gents of the roaring \u201820s were ducking in and out of speakeasies, full beards made a comeback on a distinguished set of older gents. Think snowy-haired industrialists and railroad tycoons. Or Harrison Ford in one of his don\u2019t-be-fooled-by-the-gray-I-can-still-knock-you-out phases. 1930: Dainty Mustaches 6/13 Getty Images 1930: Dainty Mustaches First there was the Charlie Chaplin mustache\u2014also known as the \u201ctoothbrush mustache\u201d because it was about the size and shape of a toothbrush. Let\u2019s not talk about that one. It went out of fashion hard. Then came the \u201cpencil mustache,\u201d popularized by Clark Gable. This thin strip across the upper lip stays out of the way of the nose, and looks down upon heavier mustaches. 1940/50: Birth of the Goatee 7/13 Getty Images 1940/50: Birth of the Goatee Dizzy Gillespie brought in the soul patch, and the Beatnik movement birthed the goatee. The early look was neat and thin\u2014think of it as a natural outgrowth of the pencil mustache. An outgrowth that could be thoughtfully stroked in a smoky jazz club. 1960: The Goatee Grows Up 8/13 Getty Images 1960: The Goatee Grows Up Counter culture. Coffee houses. Che Guevara. It was time to let those goatees be free. Mustaches reconnected with noses. Soul patches attained the length that would eventually qualify them as \u201cflavor savors.\u201d Men let their facial hair be, well, hairy, with the concept of \u201cscruff\u201d joining the revolution. 1970: The Horseshoe Mustache 9/13 Getty Images 1970: The Horseshoe Mustache The \u201870s were a huge decade for hair in general. Guys quit going to the barber. The Bee Gees were a thing. The explosion of facial hair provided the perfect canvas for the decade\u2019s greatest invention: the horseshoe mustache. It will forever belong to Hulk Hogan, but it\u2019s available to any guy who wants to throw on a trucker hat and crush a beer in his fist. 1980: The Chevron 10/13 Getty Images 1980: The Chevron The \u201880s were a mustache cage match, and there was one winner: Tom Selleck. This paragon of manhood introduced the world to his full, luxurious, lip ornament on \u201cMagnum PI.\u201d We shudder to think of him without it. Stay strong, Tom. For you, every month is Movember. 1990: Alt Goatees 11/13 Getty Images 1990: Alt Goatees Remember those well-behaved midcentury goatees? The \u201890s made the goatee-soul-patch combo the new facial hair of alt rock. It became bold and thick. We\u2019re looking at you, Fred Durst, Kid Rock, Rob Zombie\u2014the list goes on. With the right attitude, any guy can still embrace this \u201890s vibe. 2000: Five o\u2019 Clock Shadow Plus 12/13 Getty Images 2000: Five o\u2019 Clock Shadow Plus The early aughts were all about almost growing a beard. Think Keanu Reeves and Colin Farrell with soft patches of scruff dappling their jaw lines. It was a soft look that said, \u201cNever mind my beard, girl, get lost in my eyes.\u201d It was self-assured but not hyper-masculine. Which meant another big beard\u00a0blast was imminent. 2010: Lumbersexuals 13/13 Getty Images 2010: Lumbersexuals Grow \u2018em long. Grow \u2018em strong. The \u201ctwenty-teens\u201d have been defined by the biggest beard volumes in over a century. Wild and scraggly, billowing, and unkempt, these are the beards of guys who just rode in from the frontier, and are now enjoying a chai latte at their boutique design firm. But, hey, when you can impress people with the sheer number of days it\u2019s been since you last shaved, why not keep it up another week? Or another decade.

Yes, professional Jackass Ryan Dunn (and former CKYer, as well as wonderful lead character in one of the best drinking films ever made, Haggard) has only gone and got himself killed. Details are a bit all over the place right now, but my SOURCES are telling me he was driving his Porsche at 110mph, quite possibly under the influence of booze. Now, if true, this is the behaviour of a dickhead and is seriously irritating. Like when you find out people you like as musicians didn\u2019t die in (non-alcohol-influenced) car crashes, but had heroin overdoses. BRADLEY. Anyway, yes, away from the \u2018why that was a fucking stupid way to die\u2019 and toward the \u2018I like the bearded idiot because\u2019. He had a brilliant beard. Like, really brilliant. The kind of beard I genuinely wish I could grow, but I cannot. Nor will I ever be able to. This saddens me more than you could ever know. Even more than the death of the man. But aside from the beard, he just seemed like the best one of the Jackass bunch. Bam is a spoilt little shit, Steve-O a moron, Pontius even worse, Knoxville is great but wasn\u2019t there from the start and\u2026 the miscellaneous ones were just miscellaneous. Dunn appeared to be the one who would throw you through a wall just to make everyone laugh, but would then at least make a cursory effort to make sure you were okay. Then throw himself through a wall. With that beard. Plus the one where he\u2019s sat outside at a bar and says he\u2019ll get run over by the next car that goes past \u2013 then does \u2013 ranks up there as one of my favourite things I\u2019ve ever seen. I need to do a post explaining why Jackass (and to a lesser extent CKY) is one of the best things ever at some point. Just so you idiots all learn to appreciate. Anyway, while he appears to have gone out in one of the worst, most idiotic and shit ways you could possibly ever think, I\u2019m still sad to see the bearded twerp gone. And why not finish with this, because it\u2019s a bit weird in the current context: [youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_W3DK-Eu1E] Posted on 20/06/2011 by Ian D Your ultimate beard guide, now with AMAZING DRAWINGS You can tell a lot about a person by the way they wear their facial hair. Yes, I\u2019m writing something like all of those men\u2019s mags and shit websites have done in the past. Except my version will actually manage to be less funny. See, when I was growing up I was frequently told that having facial hair \u2013 specifically a beard \u2013 made you look \u2018untrustworthy\u2019. I think the people telling me this probably meant \u2018scruffy\u2019, but they stuck with people having beards failing to earn the trust of people around them. Which is odd. Anyway, as soon as my facial hair started getting darker and growing thicker I obviously grew a beard. Well, tried. Anyway, I don\u2019t agree that having a beard makes you untrustworthy. But I do think different facial hair says things about you. Also I wanted to do some drawings. So here we go. Goatee If you have this beard, you are either The Undertaker, a nerd, Gordon Freeman (see previous) or are someone who could not be bothered having a full beard. This is as deep as I can guess about your personality. Oh, you might be a biker in the mid-90s too. Standard beard If you have the Standard, as it\u2019s clearly known by everyone in the world, then I hate you. Mainly because I can\u2019t grow one properly. Still. Even though I\u2019m 27. And apparently male. So, you know, screw you if you have a Standard. I hate you. Lumberjack If you have one of these then see the above point and multiply my dislike for you by a factor of about FIFTEEN BILLION. You tosser. That weird line beard thing There\u2019s a different kind of hate going on here. No jealousy. Oh good lord no. These sculpted things I do not understand. What I do understand is that I want to remove them from the faces of the people wearing them. With a razor blade. By removing their face from their face. Makes sense. Toothbrush You are either a very funny man, or a very funny man. You are either trustworthy and intelligent, or rather untrustworthy and quite thick. You are either Chaplin or Hitler. Regardless, I\u2019m probably going to have me one of these at some point. Neckbeard You are either a prick, Amish, or me before I was convinced to let my 12-year-old\u2019s moustache grow out last year. There are more beards, but I\u2019m bored of this now. Posted on 05/04/2011 by Ian D Beard, no beard Shaving is one of those things that us of the non-Jewish disposition have to use as our confirmation of manhood \u2013 shave mitzvah, if you like. You don\u2019t shave until you can grow facial hair, and you don\u2019t grow facial hair until you\u2019re becoming a man. Well either that or you\u2019re a weird ape-child who will be featured on a Channel Five \u2018documentary\u2019 at some point in your life. Basically, it\u2019s something you look forward to as a kid, and it\u2019s something you tell your mates you\u2019re doing when you start doing it (or before, just to look cool \u2013 what japes I had as a youth!). So why, having just shaved, do I feel resolutely disappointed by this whole arrangement? Because running a sharpened blade across the contours of your face in order to groom facial hair and thus keep yourself from looking scruffy isn\u2019t as much fun as it sounds like it should be. But why? Well let me explain: It\u2019s a chore: if I don\u2019t do it, I look like a rogue 12-year-old trying to grow his first Mexican bandito moustache. Thus, if I don\u2019t want to be stared at or derided by my peers for looking like a twat, I have to shave on a semi-regular basis. It hurts sometimes: regardless of all the soothing shave gels and face creams I don\u2019t own, there is still soreness, pain and cutting involved. It\u2019s self-mutilation if anything, and to be honest I\u2019m not a big fan of it. I can\u2019t even grow a beard properly: as mentioned, my facial hair output would be embarrassing for someone who hasn\u2019t even hit puberty, never mind a 26-year-old. As such I find it a bit of an insult that my body feels the need to make anything grow on my face at all, thereby forcing me to hack it all off again. My face is a conceited little shit. The cost: if you want razor blades that are sharper than a particularly blunt lemon then you have to buy anything branded and of reasonable cost. Unfortunately, \u2018reasonable cost\u2019 here refers to things that cost about \u00a310 for four blades. And that\u2019s not even mentioning the fact they\u2019re in massive security packaging and some over-zealous cashiers feel the need to check you\u2019re not about to hack someone\u2019s balls off with them. The lies: if you shave more, it will grow back thicker \u2013 this is the route to a wonderful beard. LIES. The advertising: if we didn\u2019t have to shave, we wouldn\u2019t have Gillette. If we didn\u2019t have Gillette, we wouldn\u2019t have their adverts. Of all the badvertising in the world, theirs has to be among the worst. [youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-gnrMZTsPs&hl=en_GB&fs=1&] Why can\u2019t we all just have Paul Baribeau beards? At one point in my life, I will have one. Even if I need cosmetic surgery to make it happen. Though I do suppose without the ability to shave we wouldn\u2019t be privy to such wonders as this little ditty from Picnicface: [youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na37dOc_XSQ&hl=en_GB&fs=1&] Posted on 04/03/2010 by Ian D Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve been on aboutHere\u2019s what I\u2019ve been on about Select Category Prattle Ramblings Video Looking for something specific?

He recently received an Oscar from the motion picture academy for his role as King George VI in the movie, \u201cThe King\u2019s Speech\u201d. Here, we are going to take a look at Colin Firth short wavy hairstyles. Colin Firth messy swept back hairstyle. One style worn by Firth had the sides and back cut short. The top was left a bit longer so that it could be swept back. Razor cutting the top added some texture to his already wavy hair. A small amount of gel or pomade run through the hair with his fingers was usually enough to hold this style in place and keep it looking good. Colin Firth natural wave hairstyle. Another style that he has worn that looks really good on him is a medium short cut that left a full fringe across his forehead. The natural wave of his hair provided a substantial amount of body without the need for a great deal of product. The hair was basically left to lay where it would, giving him a sort of mussed appearance. Colin Firth hairstyle. Colin has also been seen wearing his hair with it all cut to a uniform length. Again, strategic use of a razor created additional texture and height to his style. This was possibly the lowest maintenance hairstyle he has chosen. Simply running the fingers through the hair with a dab of pomade to create a soft hold created the basic look. Colin Firth short wavy hairstyles have not changed greatly from one to another. The largest differences lay in the length of the hair. He has a nice full head of slightly curly hair that is very easy to style so that it complements his round facial shape and accents his features.

Regular updates will be posted.AFC Championship Week EntrySunday, January 23Heinz Field was truly rocking and swaying throughout the game. You could feel it in the press box, and while we joked about it, we loved it too because we know that the more it rocks, the louder the fans are.The press box was packed to the rafters. Media was in every nook and cranny. Between all of the Pittsburgh media, New York media and national media that cover an AFC Championship game, it was crazy. The game, you know what it was all about. I don\u2019t think I need to say much more. Now post-game, that was one great feeling. From the moment we got on the elevator, the coaches, Art and Dan Rooney, and some of our staff, it was the first chance to really get excited. But that went to a whole other level on the field. The atmosphere there was insane. Players were running around hugging each other, hugging all of us staff, probably hugging people they didn\u2019t even know. You could just see the joy on the players and coaches faces. The music was blaring all of the favorites, but there was nothing like hearing players singing, \u201cPittsburgh\u2019s going to the Super Bowl,\u201d while they were out on the field. Amazing. And the fans, thank you. What more can you say. You guys have been there all season and came through like champions for this one. After the players left the field \u2013 with AFC Champion shirts and hats on \u2013 it was in to the locker room where Coach Mike Tomlin greeted each player and congratulated them. That is something that never, ever gets old. Players families were going crazy too, celebrating with each other and as soon as the players and their families met up \u2013 the moments were magical. It was a perfect night, but everyone knows there is still more to accomplish.Hines Ward celebrates.Ryan Clark and Troy Polamalu are just a little happy. A wonderful moment. Mike Tomlin holds the AFC Champions Trophy.Art Rooney II and Rashard Mendenhall. Keyaron Fox celebrates.A happy Flozell Adams. Pre-Game Kickoff Update The excitement in Heinz Field pregame is completely electric. Wiz Khalifa got the crowd hyped-up performing his hit song \u201cBlack and Yellow\u201d on the stage in the South Plaza.Martina McBride did an amazing job singing the National Anthem, with Steelers fans singing along the whole time. Khalifa joined Billy Gardell, comedian and star of the CBS hit \u201cMike and Molly\u201d for the Terrible Towel Twirl. For Gardell, a lifelong Steelers fan who hails from the Swissvale area of Pittsburgh, it was an amazing moment and you could tell by watching him how much he loved it. \u201cIn my life it goes in this order, my wife, my child and this moment now,\u201d said Gardell. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing. I might pass out. \u201cSomebody asked me if I was practicing my Terrible Towel Twirl, I said yeah for 41 years. I think the towel is going to be in full power today.\u201dFormer Steelers running backs Franco Harris and Rocky Bleier served as honorary co-captains for the game.\u201cWhat a great honor,\u201d said Bleier. \u201cTo be here at the game and asked to be co-captain with Franco and be part of the Championship game, it\u2019s terrific. Walking into the stadium reminds me when we played all of those games. It\u2019s a great experience.\u201dHarris, who believes Jerome Bettis should be a first-ballot Hall of Famer, was looking forward to game. \u201cThis is what it\u2019s all about,\u201d said Harris. \u201cEverybody knows how tough this is going to be. We have our hands full. We just have to play Steelers football.\u201dPennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett was on the sidelines pre-game sporting his black and gold and is happy to have the spotlight on Western Pennsylvania tonight. \u201cFor Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania we all love our Steelers,\u201d said Governor Corbett. \u201cIt\u2019s a great deal for the Steelers to continue in this long tradition of excellence in football. It means great pride for the State of Pennsylvania.\u201dCorbett also shared that in the State dining room at the Governor\u2019s Mansion in Harrisburg he shows his Steelers pride with a sign hanging that reads, \u201cYou\u2019re In Steelers Country.\u201dAlso on the sidelines before the game was Mel Blount - who did say a week ago that this is where we would be tonight. And by the way, yes, at kickoff, the building is rocking. Literally.Early EntryPittsburgh rapper Wiz Khalifa will be singing his hit song \u201cBlack and Yellow\u201d prior to kickoff and taking part in the Terrible Towel wave. Khalifa sounded awesome during his sound check and he is pumped to be at Heinz Field.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be crazy,\u201d said Khalifa. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be monumental for me. Being from here and being able to rock in the same place the Steelers play is huge. It\u2019s the closest thing to being a Steelers player that I am going to get.\u201cIt\u2019s an honor. Being from Pittsburgh and knowing everything we have been through to this point it means a lot. When I made the song it was in support of the teams. It\u2019s great to get that same support and love back.\u201d Country music star Martina McBride returns to Pittsburgh to sing the National Anthem. \u201cI am just thrilled to be here,\u201d said McBride as she headed off the field for her sound check. \u201cI love singing the National Anthem and in this environment here with the Steelers and all of the fans it\u2019s so exciting. \u201cI am going to do my best and have all good thoughts and positive energy and will send any luck I can their way.\u201d You can tell this is a big game as the press box is packed, every seat, every inch is being used \u2013 even the lounge has media in it.A special \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d goes out today to the late Myron Cope. To all of you who had signs for him outside of Heinz Field today \u2013 nicely done.Billy Gardell (left) getting ready before the game.Governor Tom Corbett on hand to watch the game.Mel and Tianda Blount and family and friendsThe locker room is readyField pre-gameHeaded to the Press Box.

Thanks Pittsburgh Penguins and Marc Andre Fleury.....Photo by Greg Shamus/Pittsburgh SteelersFriday, January 21Friday morning arrived with plenty of snow, and even more media. The CBS crew calling the game is in today, doing production meetings with the players and coaches. Plus it\u2019s the last chance for the media to get any interviews before the game, so it was a packed house. Coach Mike Tomlin did one last round in the media room, even joking about how the media must be sick of hearing him. If anyone was expecting breaking news from it, they weren\u2019t getting anything like that. Just a simple re-cap of the day.\u201cA situational football day for us, which is normal for a Friday, we worked on some elements, third down, red zone, short yardage, goal line, continuing to march forward towards Sunday,\u201d said Tomlin. \u201cA good day\u2019s work, though, for the most part.\u201d|Among the national media who were in town this week was John Lynch doing a feature on the Steelers for the FOX pre-game show on Sunday.Lynch played for Tomlin while he was in Tampa, and told me that he has utmost respect for him and isn\u2019t surprised by the success Tomlin has had so far.\u201cI have to admit of the coaches I have played for he is the most natural born leader I have been around,\u201d said Lynch. \u201cHe has a mix of intelligence, experience because he was a player and has a way to communicate and reach different personalities that is unparalleled. I remember we lost Herm Edwards who was a pretty legendary DB coach in Tampa. They went through an exhaustive interview process, Tony Dungy and Monte Kiffin, to try and find the next Herm Edwards. I remember getting a call from Monte Kiffin when I was at the Pro Bowl. He said I have good news and bad news. I said what\u2019s the good news? He said we got you a heck of a coach. I said, well then what could be the bad news and he said you are two years older than him. \u201cThat\u2019s how it started, but players in this league don\u2019t care about age. I wanted someone to help me get better and achieve what I wanted to achieve and that\u2019s what Mike provided in a hurry. I have the ultimate respect for him.\u201dLynch added Tomlin is one of the coaches when he says something, players really do listen.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t speak just to speak. He only speaks when it\u2019s important,\u201d said Lynch. \u201cHe has a talent for saying the right thing at the right time. He has a great instinct for that. That is where his intelligence comes in. He always has something for the right moment.\u201dThe competitive side of the Steelers doesn\u2019t just come out on the field, it comes out in the locker room too \u2013 at the pool table that is. \u201cIt\u2019s a different competitive nature for us,\u201d said Hines Ward. \u201cThere is something about billiards. It\u2019s a sophisticated version of competition. We get a kick out of it.\u201dThe players have a tournament during the regular season, which Tuff Harris won, but some of the best battles come between Ward and Charlie Batch.\u201cCharlie and I are about 50-50. Some days I will sweep him, some he sweeps me,\u201d said Ward. \u201cHe is one of the better pool players because we both have pool tables at home. Unfortunately for me mine is in Atlanta and his is here. I think he has the edge because he goes home every day and works on his shots. He is right up there as one of the better pool players.\u201dBatch however claims he doesn\u2019t get in any practice shots at home.\u201cI don\u2019t play at home,\u201d said Batch. \u201cHe probably doesn\u2019t believe that. That is mental. That\u2019s what I have over him right now. Let them think that and the pressure is on them when they step over to the pool table.\u201dPractice insideAl Everest and Ryan Mundy.

Noreen hid from the camera. Thursday, January 20Things were hopping at the Steelers practice facility again today with the team practicing and the media contingent almost as big as the one that was there for the AFC Championship press conferences on Wednesday. We did an \u201cunofficial\u201d count of the media headed in to the locker room at lunch time. Normally there are about 12-15 media in the locker room at lunch time. But the last two days it was right around 50 media members each day. With many of the players working out, eating or in the training room at lunch time the media definitely outnumbered the players.Mike Wallace and Brett Keisel both spoke in the media room at lunch time before open locker room. Keisel, who is also featured in this week\u2019s Steelers Speak, joked about his playoff beard that actually has it\u2019s own Facebook page. \u201cYes, someone is doing that. I am just going to lay that out there, that it is not me,\u201d said Keisel. \u201cThere is a Twitter page too. That\u2019s not me either. Someone is having some fun with it, which I don\u2019t really mind.\u201dTroy Polamalu talked during open locker room, but you will never hear him singing his own praises. When asked if he thought the Jets would adjust their game plan this week because he will play (Polamalu was inactive the last time the two played), he had a simple answer. \u201cI don\u2019t imagine their game plan changing over one player,\u201d said Polamalu. In the middle of Polamalu talking, safety Ryan Clark interrupted and brought laughter to the locker room. \u201cHow do you feel being the second most attractive safety on this team but yet they give you the commercials,\u201d joked Clark.After practice it was the coaches who spoke, including Coach Mike Tomlin, offensive coordinator Bruce Arians and defensive coordinator Dick LeBeau. \u201cI thought we had a good practice today,\u201d Tomlin told those gathered.\u00a0 \u201cI really liked the energy and enthusiasm.\u00a0 It\u2019s an arrow up on the execution, of course, which is needed as we push forward towards Sunday.\u00a0 But we\u2019re not a finished product yet.\u00a0 It\u2019s why we have tomorrow, of course, and the day after.\u00a0 So I like where we are, we\u2019ll just continue to push forward.\u201dWhile the team is still working on things for Sunday, the game plan for entertainment for the game has come together. Country music superstar Martina McBride will sing the National Anthem and country music legend Hank Williams, Jr. will perform at halftime. Rapper and Pittsburgh native Wiz Khalifa will perform the song, \u201cBlack and Yellow,\u201d prior to the game and participate in the Terrible Towel Twirl with fellow Pittsburgh native Billy Gardell, star of the CBS series, \u201cMike and Molly\u201d.Khalifa wrote the song to pay homage to the city and the sports teams.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI always have Pittsburgh pride and I wanted to let people know where I am from and represent Pittsburgh any way I could,\u201d said the 23-year old Khalifa. \u201cThe best way is through our colors. All of our sports teams are black and yellow, well black and gold. I just took that hometown pride and turned it in to a song.\u201cPittsburgh is everything I am as far as my music and my personality. It\u2019s about how loyal we are and how we support each other. People don\u2019t get that from a lot of big cities. But Pittsburgh is a huge city but it\u2019s hometown.\u201dThe video features shots from around the city and plenty of Terrible Towels waving.\u201cIt was important to make the hometown vibe and show our city in a different way and give it that look,\u201d said Khalifa. \u201cIt got accepted and people caught on to it. It was amazing.\u201dLinebacker LaMarr Woodley had a cameo in the video and is looking forward to kicking the game off with the song. \u201cThat song speaks to us and the city of Pittsburgh,\u201d said Woodley. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be great having him sing it before the game. It\u2019s a song we like to hear and the fans like to hear so it\u2019s going to get us pumped up for the game.\u201dThe song is getting plenty of play in Pittsburgh, and could even be heard in the Steelers weight room and training room this week.\u201cThat means everything to me,\u201d said Khalifa. \u201cI have always been a Steelers fan. I started watching when I was a kid growing up in the 90s. I watched them all the way from then until now.\u201dBrett Keisel talks to the media.Mike Wallace talks to the media.Jonathan Dwyer relaxes.The media in the locker room.

So that meant one thing, the media room was packed. There weren\u2019t many empty seats and cameras were jockeying for space. Hines Ward took to the podium first, followed by James Farrior, Ben Roethlisberger and Coach Mike Tomlin. And because so many of the media were in the interview room for the press conferences, the locker room was a little emptier early on during the open media session. But by the end of practice, that wasn\u2019t the case. The tally heading in the locker room post-practice was right around 50, with other interviews happening around the practice facility, including Michael Irvin talking to James Harrison.This is the day that players sign up for tickets for the game, and let\u2019s just say that supply definitely was not up there with demand. \u201cI am getting text messages and calls from people you don\u2019t hear from in a long time,\u201d said Antwaan Randle El. \u201cYou just don\u2019t reply. That\u2019s the way you have to do it because you have people you need to reply to. It\u2019s not disrespecting anybody, but you gotta reach out to those who have been in your life.\u201dFor Randle El picking and choosing who gets the tickets is easy. \u201cIt starts with family,\u201d said Randle El. \u201cThen it\u2019s friends who are close to you, but most of the time it doesn\u2019t get beyond family. Maybe a couple of friends but mostly it\u2019s right in house.\u201dThose sentiments were echoed by his teammates. \u201cIt\u2019s a big week,\u201d said Mike Wallace. \u201cI am getting a lot of calls. I ignore them. A lot of them are numbers I never saw before. The other day someone said my grandmother gave them my number. It\u2019s crazy.

It\u2019s a good problem to have though being in the AFC Championship game.\u201dFor hometown guy Ryan Mundy, the ticket requests have been increasing as the playoffs continue.\u201cIt keeps going up,\u201d said Mundy. \u201cThe regular season wasn\u2019t too bad.

Defensive coordinator Dick LeBeau.Tuesday, January 18It\u2019s Tuesday and that means it\u2019s Mike Tomlin press conference day. There was definitely a larger than normal crowd there, the largest crowd of the year, and it included some of the New York media. Tomlin had plenty of praise for the Jets, going down the laundry list of weapons they have on offense, defense and special teams. He is impressed with what they have been able to do in the playoffs, especially on the road. \u201cIf you look at the Jets, it\u2019s really nothing short of remarkable what they have done to get to this point,\u201d said Tomlin. \u201cThey went to Indianapolis and beat those guys; they went to New England and beat those guys. They deserve to be here as do we. We are familiar with them. They have been in Heinz Field recently and whacked us, and beat us at our place. We are going to have to play better than how we did last time.\u201dAnd speaking of special teams, that is one area that he knows the team has to play better in this time around. In the game against the Jets in December Brad Smith returned the opening kickoff 97 yards for a touchdown. So when Tomlin was asked about what the team needs to do better on special teams this time around, \u201cWe need to stop Brad Smith from going 97 yards. That would be a good start,\u201d said Tomlin. \u201cThey are a very good group. It doesn\u2019t matter whether Brad Smith is back there or (Antonio) Cromartie is back there. You saw what he did to Indianapolis at a critical time. He is a very capable and dangerous return man. But they have a team of potentially capable return men. Whether you are talking about Smith, (Antonio) Cromartie, (Jericho) Cotchery or Joe McKnight, that\u2019s kind of been the signature of Coach (Mike) Westhoff\u2019s units since I have been in the league, this guy is going to have several options from a return-game standpoint. They are a good group. We have to play better than we did last time.\u201d\u00a0 Today was the players off day, but there is no time to take a break now. There was a constant flow of players in the weight room, from young guys on the practice squad to veterans like Casey Hampton.Rookie Antonio Brown, who made an amazing catch that set up the Steelers game-winning touchdown, told me he heard from a lot of family and friends after the game, congratulating him on the big play.\u201cEverybody was excited,\u201d said Brown. \u201cThey are thankful I came through with the opportunity. I was blessed. They know how hard I work and respect my game and they were happy for me. They told me what a great catch it was. They were happy for me.\u201dBrown said he was happy because he was able to contribute to the team and they had trust in him, something that is very important to him.\u201cIt\u2019s always exciting to know my teammates believe and trust in me,\u201d said Brown. \u201cFor Ben (Roethlisberger) to throw me that ball late with everything on the line, it shows they respect me as a player.\u201dBrown is among the Steelers players who are looking forward to another home game this week. He was impressed with the atmosphere at Heinz Field for the Divisional Playoff game against the Ravens and expects the same thing this week. \u201cIt was a great environment,\u201d said Brown. \u201cThere is no other place like being at Heinz Field. This week is another great opportunity to be at home and go at it again. I have never seen the crowd get as hyped as they did last week.\u201d It\u2019s always nice to see the other side of the players, and that is visible when James Harrison brings his son James to the office every Tuesday. This week, though, he had both of his sons, James and Henry. While James doesn\u2019t mind wandering the halls, Henry definitely likes to hang close to dad.Ziggy Hood makes it look easy.Steve McLendon lifting some serious weights. Frank Summers lifting.Crezdon Butler in the weight room.Tyler Grisham works out.Coach Mike Tomlin addresses the media.After his press conference, it was on to film the Mike Tomlin Show.Monday, January 17It\u2019s AFC Championship week and you can definitely feel the excitement throughout the City of Pittsburgh. Black and gold banners have replaced Christmas decorations on homes, what was once a Christmas tree in downtown is now a Terrible Tree and you can\u2019t go anywhere without seeing people in their Steelers gear and hearing them talk about the game.At the Steelers practice facility, though, the focus is solely on the game, and Ziggy Hood said it best when he told me what the focus would be.\u201cWe are going to approach this week like last week, concentrate, go out there and practice and have a good week and then go out there and play on Sunday,\u201d said Hood.Players were in Monday, with a mandatory 2 p.m. meeting. Players were in well before that with James Harrison being the earliest arrival around 7:30 a.m. That should come as no surprise to anyone. He wasn\u2019t alone in the weight room today, with many players lifting or doing cardio up until the time of their meeting.Some of the younger players, particularly those who didn\u2019t see any playing time on Saturday against the Ravens, headed over to the indoor practice facility to run and get a workout in. The morning started off quiet in the media room, but by the time the players were finished with their meetings things were buzzing in there. Ryan Clark and Maurkice Pouncey both came in and spoke to the media. Pouncey, who continues to impress me every time he speaks, gave some love to the fans.\u201cI am so happy about the home situation. That\u2019s awesome,\u201d said Pouncey. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to travel in this situation, but we are here with our great fans and another exciting game on Sunday.\u201cOur fans are great. They cause a lot of confusion out there and make every team that comes in here do the silent count. That\u2019s not the situation when we travel to different places. But when a team travels in here they are always on the silent count.\u201dHaving the Steelers back in the playoffs hasn\u2019t just energized the fan base and the city, but it also has former players pumped up. \u201cI think it\u2019s great,\u201d said former defensive end Edmund Nelson. \u201cThe best thing that happens to this town this time of year is when the Steelers are doing well and doing their thing. I always love it because the whole town perks up. It\u2019s a great happening.\u201dFormer wide receiver Louis Lipps said that the Steelers in the playoffs makes you forget about the cold, snowy weather. \u201cThis is what makes winter so good,\u201d said Lipps. \u201cThis is the best time of year. When you have this type of atmosphere you don\u2019t think about the cold. The city deserves it, they know how to handle it and welcome it. There is no better place to play a playoff game than here in Pittsburgh.\u201dThe calm media room ... didn't last long.Players get a workout in.Ryan Clark talks to the media.Maurkice Pouncey also spoke to the media.Grass finally is showing from underneath the snow!Setting up for Chalk Talk. Divisional Playoff Week EntrySaturday, January 15Wow\u2026honestly is there anything more you can say. The team showed their resiliency coming back from a 21-7 half-time deficit to win 31-24. The defense was spectacular and three second half touchdowns by Heath Miller, Hines Ward and Rashard Mendenhall, and a field goal by Shaun Suisham, led the team to victory.Some players who have been solid all season, but don\u2019t always get credit, really stood out today, including Ryan Clark, Ziggy Hood and Ike Taylor.The game was definitely the physical battle everyone expected it to be. \u201cThose two teams are (Marvin) Hagler and (Thomas) Hearns right there,\u201d said Coach Mike Tomlin. \u201cIt was great for the game of football.\u201dHines Ward, who was looking stylish after the game, also talked about the physical play and the personal foul penalty he was called for on the Steelers first possession.\u201cI got a roughness call and I had four guys beating me up,\u201d said Ward. \u201cI love it. That\u2019s what it is all about. Ed Reed and I have our battles. No disrespect to Ed. He probably thinks it\u2019s a little personal. But it\u2019s playoffs. Loser goes home. So why sit there and save it? I am going to go out there and fight, scratch and claw to win a ballgame. If Ed takes it personal, so be it. It\u2019s the playoffs. Like I said the loser goes home. So I am going out there and fighting my tail off to help my guys get open or open up a huge run. Some guys don\u2019t particularly like the way I go after guys, so the first personal foul call was just funny because I had four guys beating me up under the pile. And I come out with the personal foul. It wasn\u2019t even offsetting. I just chuckled about it.\u201dYou can be sure the players will be keeping an eye on the Patriots-Jets games tomorrow, but for now they are going to just enjoy the win over the Ravens.\u201cWe will sit back tomorrow, get to watch the Jets and Patriots play and we\u2019ll figure out do we go on the road or do they come here,\u201d said Ward. \u201cCome Monday after their game, we will figure out who we are playing.\u201dIf you have ever been to Heinz Field and seen the Renegade video, well you know how that pumps players and crowd up. Now, imagine it comes on today and all of the hits\u2026are against the Ravens. The place went insane when it was played. A shortened version of it was played later in the game, once again getting the crowd to a fever pitch. And speaking of the crowd, they definitely were the 12th man today. They were quiet when they needed to be, signaled first down loudly when it happened, and they answered the call from the players with deafening noise. And believe me, when I tell you the place was rocking, it really was. You could feel the movement in the press box after the touchdowns. Thanks to all of the fans for being so incredible today. Also thanks to the Pittsburgh Penguins for their support \u2013 we appreciate the Terrible Towel on the bench during your game. Happy 9th Birthday to Mason Tomlin\u2026dad\u2019s team definitely came through with a great birthday gift.Good day overall in Pittsburgh sports \u2026 Steelers, Penguins, Pitt, Duquesne and Robert Morris basketball teams all winner. Congrats to all.And while we\u2019re saying congrats, if you missed it Brett Keisel is headed to the Pro Bowl. Awesome news\u2026he is so deserving.Pre-Game Happenings It\u2019s game day and I can tell you the atmosphere here at Heinz Field is electric. Fans are pumped and definitely ready for the game.There was a very poignant pregame ceremony with two local military members receiving the Purple Heart they earned for their actions in combat.Private First Class Ben Long was injured when his armored vehicle was hit by an IED. Four soldiers in his squad were killed, but after a long hospital stay he rejoined his unit and returned to combat.\u00a0 Corporal Joseph Tarkett of the USMC was hit by shrapnel when his unit was struck by a remote controlled IED. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Country music star Trace Adkins sang the National Anthem. Adkins, who also appeared on the reality show Celebrity Apprentice, did an amazing rendition. \u201cThis is a thrill for me to be here today,\u201d said Adkins. \u201cI grew up a Steelers fan. Where I was from in North Louisiana growing up everyone was a Steelers fan because of (Terry) Bradshaw. I have been a Steelers fan from way back.\u201d Bret Michaels got the crowd fired up, okay they were fired up at 10 a.m., when he did the Terrible Towel Twirl before the game with his daughter Raine on the field with him. \u201cThis is such an amazing feeling to be here in town to start the Terrible Towel,\u201d said Michaels, who performed at the Steelers Playoff Party on Friday night. \u201cThe stadium was rocking. I flew back just to do this. \u201cWhen I looked around and saw we got the insanity of the Terrible Towel coming down on you, it gave me chills.\u201dAnd that flyover with four F-15s\u2026seriously that was awesome. The 391st Fighter Squadron stationed in Idaho, led by Pittsburgh natives including formation leader Captain Ray \u201cBanzai\u201d Rounds, flew 1,690 miles to get to Pittsburgh to do it.There were plenty of notables on the field before the game, including former Steelers Jerome Bettis, Rocky Bleier and John Stallworth. Also on hand was Taylor Lautner, who filmed a movie in Pittsburgh over the summer and came to a few games early in the season, and well as Omar Benson Miller, who is on CSI: Miami.Jerome Bettis, Bret and Raine Michaels and Rocky BleierJerome Bettis with Marines.John Stallworth enjoys pre-game with his son.Taylor LautnerOmar Benson MillerTrace AdkinsBret and Raine MichaelsBret and Raine Michaels do Towel TwirlSaying hello to Coach Mike Tomlin.

If there's one positive social contribution that came from the swing toward uber-hippie, 90s revivalism, it's that beards have come back into style, both in Hollywood and elsewhere. Truly, the vast majority of men look better (and more sexually provocative) with a little hair on their face, even if it's just a bit of strategically-cultivated stubble, and this is especially true of categorically attractive gentlemen who are also famous. Who are the sexiest celebrities with beards? And more importantly, which actors look better with beards than they do without them?\u00a0Many folks consider the beard (and its other, more artisanal derivatives, such as the mutton chop and the handlebar mustache) to be a pure, distinguished, and noble form of creative expression. A bearded man is a man fully realized, in all of his glorious, masculine splendor - the nuances of his individual maleness, whether dapper and well-groomed, or burly, untamed, and lumberjack-like, on proud display for the rest of the world to ponder and appreciate.From Ben Affleck, to Jon Hamm, and yes, even Brad Pitt, these celebrity guys are rocking their beards, looking oh so handsome.\u00a0In support of these brave and trail-blazing gentlemen, we present you with this list of the hottest Hollywood actors who look way, way better with a little facial hair.

But I won't say which ones... Life Imitates Art: Things with Art Alexakis Hair By Andrew Blumetti\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A long time ago, Art Alexakis was a junkie.\u00a0 After a near-fatal cocaine overdose in the early 90\u2019s, the guitarist/singer turned his life around and formed the alternative rock band Everclear.\u00a0 They broke through in 1995 with the song \u201cSanta Monica\u201d, a song about Santa Claus, or Monica from Friends or something.\u00a0 Then he wrote a truckload of songs about his lousy father that all didn\u2019t sound all too different from each other, but they did sell a lot of albums.\u00a0 It was a happy story for Art, as his once-dark life, turned into one of success, fame and fortune.\u00a0 One thing did remain constant though, Alexakis\u2019s signature bleach-blonde hair that for the most part, made him look like Annie Lennox with a goatee.\u00a0 Example below:In my humble opinion, a guy bleaching his hair at 50 years-old looks runs the risk of looking a bit silly (unless he\u2019s Hulk Hogan or Joe Pesci from Lethal Weapon 3 who both look like clowns, but we\u2019ve grown to accept).\u00a0 But don\u2019t tell that to these bottle blondes with that Alexakis \u2018do:White Castle burger:Skee Lo:Captain Caveman:David Crosby:Dracula:an orange Sour Patch Kid:Kangaroo Jack:A VHS copy of The Lawnmower Man: #Everclear\u00a0\u00a0#alternative\u00a0\u00a0#90's music\u00a0\u00a0#Dracula\u00a0\u00a0#The Lawnmower Man\u00a0\u00a0#Skee Lo\u00a0\u00a0#Captain Caveman\u00a0\u00a0#funny\u00a0\u00a0#humor\u00a0\u00a0#Art\u00a0\u00a0#Annie Lennox\u00a0\u00a0#Crosby\u00a0\u00a0#Sour Patch Kids\u00a0\u00a0#Santa Monica 5 years ago on August 05, 2011 at 01:39pm 0 notes \u2190 Previous Next \u2192 !all of the stuff i post i do not take credit for unless otherwise posted!",

The history of the goatee goes back to ancient Roman and ancient Greek times where Gods were depicted with goatee styled facial hair. It has also gained popularity around the 90s through to present times, with men being able to maintain and get creative with their beards with the advancements of beard trimming technology. Maintaining a goatee can be difficult, especially if you don\u2019t have the right tools and processes. For years men have only had disposable razors and sub-standard electric razors to tame the beast, and I still see guys struggling today. You only have to look on places like Quora or male grooming forums and groups on Facebook to see them asking for advice on the correct way to shape a goatee or what trimmers to use. It\u2019s daunting when you have spent all that time and effort growing a goatee for you then to mess it up when you go to shape or trim it. Trimming a goatee isn\u2019t the hardest thing to do in the world. Let\u2019s face it, it\u2019s not calculus or quantum physics, however there are a few rules to go by in order to shape and keep a goatee in good order. So here\u2019s my guide on everything you need to know about goatees, which will cover shaping goatees, styling goatees and trimming them so they look neat, smart and well kept. I will go through the important stages a man should take to shape his goatee in the best way possible for the best outcome possible. Follow my lead and you will get the perfect goatee. All that I am about to reveal is a product of my Father teaching me how he kept his beard and also through my trials and tribulations as a bearded man for much of my adult life. Tools That You Will Need To Shape Your Goatee It\u2019s quite a simple little set of tools you will need to shape and maintain your goatee. 1. First up you will need a really good beard trimmer to be able to shape your goatee. To get that really well kept look, an electric beard trimmer is a must. I\u2019ve listed the best 3 beard trimmers\u00a0here for you take a look. 2. Secondly, a nice sharp pair of scissors and a comb. 3. Thirdly, a good quality electric razor or disposable razor, whatever you prefer to shave with. Check out the best electric razors for 2017 here! Lastly you might want to use some product on your beard like wax or a good quality beard oil. I\u2019m not one for using any product at all, but I know some guys like to condition their beard as it makes it feel good and healthy looking. It\u2019s up to you. So let\u2019s get started with my goatee grooming guide! Step # 1 \u2013 The Growing I\u2019m going to state the obvious here but to get the best looking goatee beard you need to have a fair bit of growth. Go without shaving for a week or two to really get a nice full and thick beard to work with. This will give you more than enough to work with when you do actually start to shape your goatee. It doesn\u2019t take long to achieve this style of facial hair compared to other beards. A truly epic goatee will take no more than 3 weeks to achieve. Step # 2 \u2013 Think about the shape of your goatee When you\u2019ve grown enough beard to be in a position to shape a goatee, then now is the time to get thinking about how it\u2019s going to look. Goatees do come in different shapes and sizes. You might like the idea of a narrow goatee or a more rounded style to suit your facial bone structure. One tip I can offer when it comes to planning your goatee is to draw lines on your face with a market pen where you might want to shape to and see what that looks like. Just remember to use a washable marker and not a permanent one! Here are some goatee styles to get inspiration from and to see what style would suit your face. A goatee beard can do wonders for you if you have a small round face, because it can make your face seem longer. If you have a long face long then you might want to go for a half goatee where you have a stubble moustache and a small beard on the tip of the chin. A small chin-only goatee with a light moustache is a good style as it\u2019s pretty much transferrable to any face shape, even more so if you have a small thin face. Moving slightly away from the traditional goatee, you can have a chin strip which is a distant cousin to the goatee \ud83d\ude09 This suits square and triangular faces. You need to be able to figure out how far you want your goatee to be in relation to your chin, whether you want to grow it down towards your neck or to have it stop at the edge of your chin. From my experience of having once had a goatee beard, I have found that a three finger width gap between your adams apple and the bottom of your goatee is a good measurement to work to. So to do this just put your hand under your chin so that your three fingers are going from right to left. The fit two or three finger widths between your adams apple and your chin and go with the point to trim to. This isn\u2019t always good for everyone, so please do what you feel is right for your face. Your next decision is the length of your goatee from you chin. Do you keep it nice and short / tight to your face or have a bit of length coming down. This decision can be made over time as it takes longer to grow the length in a beard. Step 3 \u2013 Comb the beard before trimming To do the first shape on your soon to be goatee, you need to make sure that your beard is combed through. Get a fine-toothed comb or beard brush and\u00a0brush it down through the beard. You don\u2019t want any curled hair as this could mean you take a chunk of beard out and be left with patches. By combing through you will free up tangles as well. Next you will want to take your beard trimmer and set it to the desired length you want your beard, so you get the beard nice and even in length. Best Electric Beard Trimmers For Shaping Goatees Electric beard trimmers are a great convenience for the shaping and upkeep of goatee beards. We have identified the best 3 electric beard trimmers for shaping and up-keeping a goatee beard and the best thing is that they don\u2019t cost the earth. Beard trimmers are an essential bit of kit when it comes to maintaining a goatee. They will get long and unkept looking if you don\u2019t trim it now and again, and the easiest way to do this is by having an adjustable trimmer that will regulate the length of your goatee beard. Philips Series 9100 Laser Guided Beard Trimmer I use this trimmer all the time. I love it as it has a laser to guide you when you are shaping your goatee. It\u2019s ideal for those who have an eye for exceptional facial hair detail and for those who are complete newbies when it comes to beard growing and shaping. The laser just makes everything 10x easier! This amazing bit of beard trimming kid is one of the most advanced ways to keep your goatee in order and easiest too. Achieving perfectly straight lines is a breeze and if you want to try out more complex styles like linking up the side burns with your goatee then this is the trimmer for you. It features 17 LED displayed lengths from 0.4mm to 7mm, which means that you can not only go close shave, but also trim the longer bearded areas of you face. The Philips 9100 has steel blades which are really durable and will last you years. It\u2019s totally waterproof, so you can use it in the shower if you want and it\u2019s perfect for on the go. Another great feature about the Phillips 9100 is the dual sided trimmer to get in and shave those hard to reach areas like under the nose or under the chin. This is my number one choice of beard trimmers for goatee beards. BaByliss for Men Super Stubble Like the Phillips 9100, the BaByliss super stubble is one of the best ways to maintain your goatee beard. The Babyliss Super Stubble is designed for guys who want total control of their goatee beard, giving them the tools to shape and trim. There\u2019s 24 precise settings on Babyliss super stubble, so you can go short or long, as it uses a motorised length control. Get the exact length and look you want at a touch of a button. It has a floating head feature which allows the razor to follow the contours of your face. Get close in to the defined line of your goatee with the electro-chemically sharpened blades for a super accurate cut. Braun cruZer 6 Face Another reliable and versatile shaver for the goatee beard wearer. Braun\u2019s cruZer 6 Face is great value for money for a well built and functional beard trimmer. With this trimmer you can do all three of trimming, styling and shaving, which makes the Braun a jack of all trades and master of all!! You get 4 trimming lengths on this trimmer which is ideal for maintaining a goatee. Add this to the SmartFoil technology and the Braun can capture hairs growing in different directions. It\u2019s fully waterproof so you can use it in the shower. The cruZer 6 also has a twistable, two sided trimmer which makes trimming and finishing off a goatee style easy as pie! Step 4 \u2013 The Outline This is the most important stage of achieving the perfect goatee. Outlining the shape is vital and as a guide you should use the angle of your moustache, as this will tell you how wide your goatee will be on your chin. As I mentioned earlier, you could use a washable marker to outline the design and create a cutting guide. Step 5 \u2013 The Cutting Once you have the outline sorted and you\u2019re happy with what you see, you can then start the exciting part of the process\u2026the shaving!! Three weeks of growth, itching and wanting to have a shave is about to come to an end! You will finally have a badass goatee! What you will need to do next is to cut to the outline of the goatee. Define this by using a very sharp razor or a trimmer that doesn\u2019t have a guard. I find the best way to define the goatee is to use the sharpest razor possible. I use a Gillette Fusion for this, as it gives that sharp definition you need for a goatee. Shave right up against the sides of the hair. Make sure your beard has been wet with nice warm water as this makes shaving it easier. What you will get is an incredibly well-defined line at the sides and underneath. I like to start from my neck by making small shaving strokes against the growth direction of your beard at all times. Shave up to two to three figure widths from the adams apple, so you get a basic idea of how your goatee will take shape. This way you\u2019re not cutting too far in to the goatee as its always easier to take more off, if need be once you have a look and assess where you are at. Step 6 \u2013 Making Amends To The Shape So you have cut to your outline using either a razor or an un-guarded trimmer, and you now have a goatee shape. Now what you want to do is take a look at what you have and see if you need to make any more amends to the shape. You may feel that you want to bring up the goatee under your chin or make the sides thinner. If that\u2019s the case then just make another outline on the areas you want to trim and repeat the process. Step 7 \u2013 Shaving the rest of your beard. When you grow a goatee you really need to just grow a full beard to start with, as this makes it easier to shape. Once you have shaped the goatee, you will need to shave the rest of the face that will remain clean shaven. Bath the face in warm water to make the beard nice and soft. Massage in some shaving foam to prepare my skin for shaving. I use clear shaving gel, so that I can see the defined edges of my goatee, so I can get it nice and close to my hair line. To get a close shave to the definition line of your goatee, always shave away from the goatee line. Because the skin is soft and slippery because of the gel or shaving foam, the razor can easily cut more than what you would have wanted to. The last thing you want is to take a chunk of hair out of your newly defined goatee! You\u2019d have to start again! Put the razor on the defined line of your goatee and shave away from it. This applies to guys who are using an electric razor as well. Step # 8 \u2013 Step Away And\u00a0Take A Look After every major cut, just step back and take a look at your efforts. Check it out from a distance and see what it looks like. Make sure you have a close up look as well, as you can miss out things when you are concentrating hard on the outline of the goatee. Step 9 \u2013 The Clean Up Once you have completed all of the steps listed above, it\u2019s time to clean up and reveal your awesome new goatee! Wash you face in some clean warm water to wash away all the loose hair and soap from your beard and face. You can then apply different products to enhance the beard and moisturize the beard, but this depends on each person\u2019s own personal preference. Shaving and goatee trimming can be very messy, so make sure you clean the bathroom after or you will be in deep trouble with the woman / women in your life! Final Thoughts At the end of the day, how you decide to shape your goatee is completely up to you as its your goatee and you need to feel comfortable with it. Make it unique to you and have it fit your own sense of style, but ultimately keep it well and make sure you trim every two weeks so it looks nice and tight.

Richard Lee McNAIR Police have positively identified a sighting of McNair at a Wal-Mart in Penticton, BC, Canada, in April 2006. Confirmed Sighting: Police say this is McNair at a Wal-Mart in Penticton in April 2006. Confirmed Sighting: Police say this is McNair in a Penticton Blockbuster Video in April 2006. This self-portrait of McNair was taken with a digital camera found in the car the fugitive allegedly abandoned in Canada on April 28, 2006. Cops say McNair may have been taking these photos of himself as part of a scheme to obtain an ID. McNair apparently took several pictures of himself with the digital camera. Cops say the camera also held photos of places he'd been while on the lam -- including this picturesque beach in Penticton, Canada. That's McNair up there on the roof. A Minot Daily News photographer caught McNair in the act during his first escape in 1988, as he lept from rooftop to rooftop in Minot, N.D. He had used lip balm to squeeze out of cuffs and make a break for it. This photo, originally published in the Minot Daily News newspaper in 1988, is of McNair after he launched himself off of the rooftop of a three-story building. Back in 1988, Ward County Sheriff's deputies uncovered a McNair escape plot when they found two cinderblocks chiseled out of his holding cell. Not too long after his first escape attempt in 1988, Ward County, N.D. Sheriff's deputies foiled another attempt when they found cinderblocks chiseled out in McNair's cell. Deputies discovered these bedsheets McNair had hidden behind the cinderblocks -- this time McNair's escape was foiled in the planning stages. Back in 1992 and 1993, when McNair escaped from the North Dakota State Penn, he died his hair blond. Cops think he may do that again. The convicted killer has changed a lot over the years he has been in the prison system. These mug shots are from McNair's original booking in Minot, North Dakota on murder charges in 1988. McNair after his 1988 foiled escape attempt. The Bismarck North Dakota State Pen deemed McNair too difficult for the state system to handle and he was transferred out to the Federal Prison system. Another older mug shot from McNair's North Dakota days, this one is him clean shaven. McNair sporting a goatee for a 90's mug shot Richard Lee McNair October 2007 (Royal Canadian Mounted Police photo) This is the last mug shot of McNair in the system. home last updates contact",

It shows that you're not afraid to look like a man. An unkempt beard is lazy. Shave your neck at least. That shows that your beard is a choice, and not a de-facto state because you couldn't be bothered. A mustache alone makes you look either like a porn star or a dictator. Neither will make a positive impression.

However, to achieve such glorious results it must be grown to a thickness greater than an inch - the so called Mercury Minimum. Ideally, it should also develop its own flair, either the classic Mexican Bandito twirl, a french twist or flick, or the daring catfish barbels. All of these require a 'stache of exceptional thickness and body (much like a porn star) and utilize the bareness of the chin to flaunt their facial hair. Think of it as a two-piece beard, and ask yourself if you're the sort of guy that would wear a bikini if he were a lady. do you really have the facial assets to pull it off and turn heads without people wandering where the rest of it is? If yes, lucky you! Go enjoy your soup strainer. If no, I highly recommend the stylish goatee. It is a classy statement of manliness that looks equally at home in the office, or relaxing by the pool.

How can you argue a stashe isn't cool? Please note my 'almost chops' sideburns. Once they reach chops-hood, I'll be so happy lol Yeah, it sure ain't cool. Shave that hideous thing. You don't need to be wearing any facial hair until you are able to grow non patchy hair, or if you are dating a hippy chick with hair in her pits. Mustaches - In current American society, having one is hard to pull off. Whether you believe it or not, having many styles actually can label you as Gay, especially if you are either a short male, or a super star model with a hairless body and 6 packs. There is a strong aversion to mustaches because usually pedophiles have them as seen on t.v., and this is what sticks into most people's back-brain. There is actually something unsettling about having a mustache. Oddly enough, if you have a 'crazy' mustache, such as a handle bar or German swoosh style 'staches, they can be seen as very unique, distinct and manly. Beards - SHAVE. YOUR. NECK. It does many things. Shaving your neck makes you appear thinner with a sharper jaw line. It shows you have class. Having a full beard can be seen as a sign of a lumberjack/hillbilly/mountain man. If you sport a beard for X weeks/months, then shave it, you will appear years younger to people for about half the time you had the beard. Also, don't attempt to grow a beard unless you can grow a beard that is full and not patchy. Patchy hair makes you look dirty and disgusting. If you can only grow patchy hair, God didn't intent for you to have one. Unless you are a dumpster diving hippy. Mustaches two thumbs down unless you are going nutz. Beards two thumbs up only if you know how to wear one.

Don't ruin a perfectly good face by stapling a rat to it. A mustache is all that much worse because you not only look like you stapled a rat to your face but it's a creepy rat.

I had no idea that the trucker-stasch had such effect on people. Now it's pretty easy to see which ones are weirded out by it and defuse any \"Are you a sociopathic serial killer?\" stuff. (Or enhance it when teen-girls are freaked out by it. I'm going to hell >_&lt I wouldn't recommend having this type of facial hair if you are working in sales though. And trim it down before the first meeting with important stuck-up clients. The Lemmy-look doesn't go well with financial types. (Or just let your creative director do the talking) ETA: Burt, although he had awesome facial hair in Deliverance, didn't have a 'stasch going below his mouth IIRC?

I'm trying to loose three stone over the next year, and I thought to make things interesting whille I'm hopefully loosing weight, I'll be gaining chin and under the nose hair. You know just to blow folks I know minds from two angles. So yeah, for the first time ever in my 37years I am trying to grow a mustache, goatee combo, a bit like 'evil' Spock, might even go for the whole pointy bit at the bottom. Any advice on how to care for it. I was thinking on buying one of these trimmer kit things. Are they worth it, or will a good old pair of nail scissors and patience bring about the same results? Any advice will be appreciated. Oh and I'm nearly two weeks in, so my mustache has got to, spikey, its sticking out in odd directions, could do with a brush and trim time.

Well, not indispensable, but far more convenient than the alternative; basically shaving every day, using the scissors you mentioned, and obtaining a straight razor for those times you might let it go a bit.

That thing is just plan horrible. In fact I had pretty much this exact conversation with my roommate after watching a movie where a mustache like that had a lot of screen time: Me: \"Ugh, he really needs to shave. That thing is an eyesore\" Her: \"Really? It's awesome\" Me: \"You've to be kidding, it's gross\" Her: \"Well yeah, I could never date or touch a man with a mustache like that, but it's still awesome in a way\" Me: \"I guess I get what you're saying, but still\" So yeah. A mustache might make you a neat side-show, something kind of cool to gawk at, like a car crash, explosion, crazed badger or a mullet. However like all those things it's not really something most people want to get close to.

In folk and blues, a beard is required to demonstrate you have the necessary gravitas for the subject matter; in metal the beard is a sign of strength. Or maybe because you don't have a proper job and don't have to look smart in an office, you think, why not? We take a look at 20 of the best beards in music today, and of yesteryear. Images: Rex/AllstarBill Gibbons, Dusty Hill & Frank BeardShare on FacebookTweetShare via WhatsAppAttributes: 2 x long and strong, 1 x no beard, but called Beard Chronicle of the chin: Where else to start but the mighty ZZ Top? As if boasting twin frontmen who have sported huge and impressive beards since the dawn of time wasn't enough, they have a drummer, with no beard, called Frank Beard. It was almost as though he realised that if he joined in with the growth it would just be too much for the world to handle.Dave GrohlShare on FacebookTweetShare via WhatsAppAttributes: Brown, heavy, rugged Chronicle of the chin: Dave Grohl is one of those people who is perhaps just too perfect. Best drummer of his generation, anthemic songwriter and singer, awesome axeman and nicest guy in rock. We should hate him, but how can you have anything against a man with a beard so strong, manly and rock? Resistance is futile: Dave we are not worthy.Rick RubinShare on FacebookTweetShare via WhatsAppAttributes: Grey, bushy, Jesus Chronicle of the chin: As befits someone credited with resurrecting the careers of many legends who thought their best days were behind them, Rubin has taken to sporting a serious Jesus beard in the last decade. A shamen-like figure in the studio, we'd definitely do whatever he told us to do, as long as we got to have a stroke of that beautiful thing.George MichaelShare on FacebookTweetShare via WhatsAppAttributes: Fine, delicate, stubbly Chronicle of the chin: Sure, George has had a plethora of hit records and sung with pretty much every great artist out there, but his greatest achievement? The prime exponent of designer stubble. Oft-imitated, never beaten, no-one rocks the precision facial fur like George. Craig David and Jason Derulo, if you think you can compete with George, you're taking the Michael.John LennonShare on FacebookTweetShare via WhatsAppAttributes: Dark, strong Chronicle of the chin: Once a baby-faced, clean shaven nice boy from Liverpool, when Lennon wanted to show he was serious about world peace and anti-capitalism, he brought out the full Jesus look. You simply have to trust a man with a good beard who stays in bed all day. Or, at the very least, admire his lifestyle.Kerry KingShare on FacebookTweetShare via WhatsAppAttributes: Seriously long, thick, nuanced Chronicle of the chin: The first appearance of a god of metal on the list, and they come no finer than Kerry King of Slayer. Fully bald, in order to draw even more attention to the hair-snake upon his chin, this is a truly stunning example of just what can be achieved in the beard arena. Best viewed during a headbanging session accompanied by some mighty riffs.Barry GibbShare on FacebookTweetShare via WhatsAppAttributes: Golden, sleek Chronicle of the chin: Part man, part lion, Barry was, and is, the coolest member of the Bee Gees. Brought disco to the masses at the same time as constantly wearing white suits with large collars, to match his perfect white teeth, juxtaposed with a silky mane and beautiful beard. A gold chain too? Yeah, why the hell not.Simon NeilShare on FacebookTweetShare via WhatsAppAttributes: Brown, thick & lustrous Chronicle of the chin: A strong pretender to the throne of best beard in rock today, Biffy Clyro's Simon Neil has never been afraid to unleash his beard, even dyeing it blonde at one stage, which made him look like a young Gandalf. The Scottish have always been proud wearers of face fuzz and, without doubt, Neil is their modern-day Beard Braveheart.Shavo OdadjianShare on FacebookTweetShare via WhatsAppAttributes: Long, thin, braided Chronicle of the chin: System of a Down bass player Shavo is certainly inappropriately-named, for this man does not shave (well, not his chin anyway, and that's what counts). Sporting a scaled, braided beard that is truly mesmerising, Odadjian is a worthy member of the magnificent metal beard club (if that doesn't actually exist, it should do).Seasick SteveShare on FacebookTweetShare via WhatsAppAttributes: White, fulsome, hobo Chronicle of the chin: Becoming a famous modern-day bluesman hasn't changed Steve - he looks pretty much the same as he did when he was homeless. A lovely classic, straggly white number; if the popularity ever dries up, he could at least take up a career as a shopping mall Santa.Kenny RodgersShare on FacebookTweetShare via WhatsAppAttributes: white, classic Chronicle of the chin: A man almost as famous for his beard as his music, we're pretty sure there's never been a point in Kenny's life where he hasn't had a full fuzz. His mother must have been pretty surprised. Lending gravitas to this god of country, his beard is a crucial part of who he is, and of course, the many people who aspire to be him, all listed at the brilliant www.menwholooklikekennyrodgers.com.Ben BridwellShare on FacebookTweetShare via WhatsAppAttributes: Dark, unkempt, shaggy Chronicle of the chin: Flying the flag for today's discerning Americana beard-wearers, Band of Horses' Ben Bridwell keeps it country with this effort. A serious musician needs a serious beard, and set off against a white shirt and waistcoat, we know this man means business.Mick FleetwoodShare on FacebookTweetShare via WhatsAppAttributes: Big and beardy Chronicle of the chin: Very much like Kenny Rodgers, the beard has been an integral part of the Fleetwood look for his entire career. Staying with him through lineup changes, (top) hair loss, marriage and divorce, the one thing Mick can rely on is his facial hair - you can see the love for it in his eyes. Having sported a variety of styles through to today's silver fox affair, our personal favourite is the 'Brit Award Disaster-Era' beard, accessorised with neckerchief, hat and microphone stand too small for him.Serj TankianShare on FacebookTweetShare via WhatsAppAttributes: Brown, perfectly square Chronicle of the chin: The second member of System of a Down to appear on this hotly-contested run down, Serj goes for the angular look, with a pure square of chin fur accompanied by tidy vertical sideburns and a straight horizontal 'tache. If this was in a gallery it would be hailed as art. It must be a good beard - have you seen how happy he looks?Ray LaMontagneShare on FacebookTweetShare via WhatsAppAttributes: Dark, generally bushy, serious Chronicle of the chin: Big Ray has a voice like a bear and fur to match. Has never knowingly smiled, but we think that's just down to his constant concentration, silently urging his beard to grow thicker and stronger. A noble ambition in life if ever there was one.Michael EavisShare on FacebookTweetShare via WhatsAppAttributes: Grey/white, solid Chronicle of the chin: A truly bold style of beard from Eavis, as it is an oasis of follicles in a face hair-desert. 'Mr Upside-Down Face' is as famous for his beard as his festival, as he was awarded Beard of the Decade in 2009 by the BLF (Beard Liberation Front) ahead of Fidel Castro. We need give no more justification for his place in this list.Kyp MaloneShare on FacebookTweetShare via WhatsAppAttributes: Big, bushy, salt 'n' pepper Chronicle of the chin: A true star of the new brigade, the TV On The Radio guitarist, bass player and vocalist nonchalantly displays this magnificent effort; a full bush of a beard, with flecks of grey amongst a mainly dark sea. They may not have songs for radio, but that beard should be on TV. All the time.Yusuf Islam aka Cat StevensShare on FacebookTweetShare via WhatsAppAttributes: tidy, dignified, grey/white Chronicle of the chin: A real ambassador for the beard, Yusuf's commitment to facial decoration has survived career highs, lows, withdrawal from music, re-entry, and conversion to Islam. Named a Man of Peace by Mikhail Gorbachev, in a just world, he would receive an award for Man of Beard from ZZ Top. Maybe we should write to them and suggest it.Claudio SanchezShare on FacebookTweetShare via WhatsAppAttributes: Loads of hair, loads of beard Chronicle of the chin: Perhaps we're being influenced by the big hair here, but the combination of it with the still-impressive-on-its-own beard is truly a sight to behold. The frontman of Coheed & Cambria, who make dense, thick and big songs, Carlos is a literal representation of them onstage. Strongly rumoured that his hair is so big because his body is lighter than air and would float into space if he ever cut it off.Mark EverettShare on FacebookTweetShare via WhatsAppAttributes: Big, bushy and dark Chronicle of the chin: Eels' frontman Mark 'E' Everett has famously experienced some very tough times in his life, with cancer, suicide and terrorism all affecting members of his family. However, he always seems to channel this into a generally positive outlook on life; perhaps when it all gets too much, he gives that magnificent beard a cuddle, and everything feels better.Read more on:musicgroomingShare on FacebookTweetShare via WhatsAppCommentShare on FacebookTweetShare via WhatsAppEmailRelatedHow to grow a beardVIDEO: A beard backwardsThe biggest celebrity hair of the 80sCommentsMoreGroomingSupermodel Paul Sculfor tells us how to be the perfect catchTips from a man who knows better than anyone20 Mar 2017GroomingMeet the judges for the 2017 ShortList Grooming AwardsWe're back with the best new products for 201717 Mar 2017Grooming5 of the biggest men's hair trends for 2017You're not actually going to get a six-pack, so settle for a slick new haircut insteadby\u00a0Jamie Carson03 Jan 2017Grooming8 express grooming treatments for the discerning yet curious manWhen you want to look good but just don't have the timeby\u00a0Jamie Carson13 Dec 2016GroomingManscaping; what is it, how to do it and how short is TOO shortAfter a lifetime of assuming that all guys went au naturale, Josh Burt realised that everything he knew was wrongby\u00a0Josh Burt13 Dec 2016GroomingTrim your pubic hair?

They want their soul patch back By Patrick Huguenin February 16, 2017 Getty Images Every decade has its style, whether it\u2019s top hats and monocles or parachute pants and Airwalks. Facial hair is no different. Every mutton chop, soul patch, and handlebar mustache belongs to its own special time\u2014and just because these guys belong in the modern decade doesn\u2019t mean their beards do. Here are 13 modern men with decade-specific facial fuzz. Where does yours belong?

In fact, Abe Lincoln was the first bearded president. With him came the \u201cchin curtain,\u201d a beard that starts just above your jaw line and goes straight down. Abe made his extra chin-y by wearing it without a mustache, and to be perfectly honest, no one has pulled it off since. 1870: Sensational Sideburns 2/13 Getty Images 1870: Sensational Sideburns The face-flanking beasts known as sideburns didn\u2019t get their name until the spectacularly scruffy Civil War general Ambrose Burnside rose to fame. His cottony white cheek fluff grew to magnificent length and connected over his lip, leaving his chin bare. It\u2019s a look that makes a man look like a zany inventor\u2014or a meme. 1880/90: The Full Bush 3/13 Getty Images 1880/90: The Full Bush Thanks to history's two hairiest presidents\u2014Rutherford Hayes and, briefly, James Garfield\u2014the last part of the century was a beard-growin' free-for-all. In this bushy period, long before the invention of the electric clipper, facial hair was allowed to be free. There is a strong possibility that your facial hair right now is nostalgic for this era. 1900/10: The Handlebar Mustache 4/13 Getty Images 1900/10: The Handlebar Mustache Contrary to hipster belief, the handlebar mustache was invented at the turn of the century\u2014not in an artist\u2019s Williamsburg garage circa 2009. President Taft brought the art of tip-twirling to the White House, where it left such an impression that another mustache hasn\u2019t inhabited the Oval Office since. 1920: The Distinguished Uncle 5/13 Getty Images 1920: The Distinguished Uncle While the young gents of the roaring \u201820s were ducking in and out of speakeasies, full beards made a comeback on a distinguished set of older gents. Think snowy-haired industrialists and railroad tycoons. Or Harrison Ford in one of his don\u2019t-be-fooled-by-the-gray-I-can-still-knock-you-out phases. 1930: Dainty Mustaches 6/13 Getty Images 1930: Dainty Mustaches First there was the Charlie Chaplin mustache\u2014also known as the \u201ctoothbrush mustache\u201d because it was about the size and shape of a toothbrush. Let\u2019s not talk about that one. It went out of fashion hard. Then came the \u201cpencil mustache,\u201d popularized by Clark Gable. This thin strip across the upper lip stays out of the way of the nose, and looks down upon heavier mustaches. 1940/50: Birth of the Goatee 7/13 Getty Images 1940/50: Birth of the Goatee Dizzy Gillespie brought in the soul patch, and the Beatnik movement birthed the goatee. The early look was neat and thin\u2014think of it as a natural outgrowth of the pencil mustache. An outgrowth that could be thoughtfully stroked in a smoky jazz club. 1960: The Goatee Grows Up 8/13 Getty Images 1960: The Goatee Grows Up Counter culture. Coffee houses. Che Guevara. It was time to let those goatees be free. Mustaches reconnected with noses. Soul patches attained the length that would eventually qualify them as \u201cflavor savors.\u201d Men let their facial hair be, well, hairy, with the concept of \u201cscruff\u201d joining the revolution. 1970: The Horseshoe Mustache 9/13 Getty Images 1970: The Horseshoe Mustache The \u201870s were a huge decade for hair in general. Guys quit going to the barber. The Bee Gees were a thing. The explosion of facial hair provided the perfect canvas for the decade\u2019s greatest invention: the horseshoe mustache. It will forever belong to Hulk Hogan, but it\u2019s available to any guy who wants to throw on a trucker hat and crush a beer in his fist. 1980: The Chevron 10/13 Getty Images 1980: The Chevron The \u201880s were a mustache cage match, and there was one winner: Tom Selleck. This paragon of manhood introduced the world to his full, luxurious, lip ornament on \u201cMagnum PI.\u201d We shudder to think of him without it. Stay strong, Tom. For you, every month is Movember. 1990: Alt Goatees 11/13 Getty Images 1990: Alt Goatees Remember those well-behaved midcentury goatees? The \u201890s made the goatee-soul-patch combo the new facial hair of alt rock. It became bold and thick. We\u2019re looking at you, Fred Durst, Kid Rock, Rob Zombie\u2014the list goes on. With the right attitude, any guy can still embrace this \u201890s vibe. 2000: Five o\u2019 Clock Shadow Plus 12/13 Getty Images 2000: Five o\u2019 Clock Shadow Plus The early aughts were all about almost growing a beard. Think Keanu Reeves and Colin Farrell with soft patches of scruff dappling their jaw lines. It was a soft look that said, \u201cNever mind my beard, girl, get lost in my eyes.\u201d It was self-assured but not hyper-masculine. Which meant another big beard\u00a0blast was imminent. 2010: Lumbersexuals 13/13 Getty Images 2010: Lumbersexuals Grow \u2018em long. Grow \u2018em strong. The \u201ctwenty-teens\u201d have been defined by the biggest beard volumes in over a century. Wild and scraggly, billowing, and unkempt, these are the beards of guys who just rode in from the frontier, and are now enjoying a chai latte at their boutique design firm. But, hey, when you can impress people with the sheer number of days it\u2019s been since you last shaved, why not keep it up another week? Or another decade.

It's not a choice!\" Pitt said of his new \u2018do, which will reportedly appear in the upcoming WWII movie \u201cFury.\u201d Pitt\u2019s new look got us reminiscing about all the different hairstyles he\u2019s sported through the years: from long, bleached-blonde locks in the '90s, to a buzzed head in the early 2000s, to the various - vastly unpopular - scraggly beards. Click through the slideshow above to see Brad Pitt\u2019s hair evolution. (Tumblr)Brad Pitt, Thelma and Louise 1991 Pitt showed off his long, blonde hair (and his body!) in his breakthrough role as a small-time criminal in \u201cThelma & Louise,\u201d beginning his career as a Hollywood heartthrob. (REUTERS)Brad Pitt, 1994 1994 However, as he became more successful, Brad went for an unkempt look: long, bleached blonde hair with dark roots and a patchy beard. This is what he looked like at the premiere of \u201cInterview with a Vampire\u201d! (REUTERS)Brad Pitt, 1995 1995 Thankfully, Brad soon traded in his long locks for a cleaner look \u2013 and took a much-needed shower as well!

(REUTERS)Brad Pitt, 1998 1998 Now, this tousled hair \u2013 in his natural color \u2013 is the style we think of when we think of \u201890s Brad. (REUTERS)Jennifer Aniston Brad Pitt 2000 Brad and Jen didn\u2019t have the same hairstyle, but they shared the same blonde hair color and blue eyes, making them the all-American couple of the \u201890s. (REUTERS)Brad Pitt, 2002 2002 Brad has occasionally worn a long, scraggly beard at different points in his career \u2013 always an unpopular look. (REUTERS)Brad Pitt, 2003 2003 This long \u2018do \u2013 bleach-free this time! \u2013 and mini soul patch is so 2003. (REUTERS)Brad Pitt, 2004 2004 And then he went completely buzzed \u2013 what a haircut that must have been! (REUTERS)Brad Pitt, 2005 2005 Back to the bleach again! (REUTERS)Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, 2006 2006 And then dark \u2013 matching his new girlfriend, Angelina Jolie.

In choosing the how to style your beard you must not only consider your face shape but also put various other issues into consideration like your hairstyle and age. For example, if you are only 20 years of age and you wearing a mustache trust me you are going to look much older than you really are. No matter which beard style you are going in for, a good regular trim accompanied with the right maintenance products(beard grooming kits) will help to keep you looking your best. That said, let us get straight into the 20 best beard styles for men in 2016 -2017 that will make most men grab thousands of compliments. Beard Styles for Men with Longer Hair \u2013 Modern Beard Styles for Men A lot of things make a man look classy and different, it could be his dress code, personality and so many others but your beard style adds a lot to it. If you have been looking out for that modern beard style to make you look sexier and more respectable then below are some cool ideas. Clearly, we can spot that he has a long face shape but the the thickness of his beard creates a wider appearance. This beard style will look great on any guy in his late 20s to 30s and can pass to be taken to series of places like office, party or another special event. From the 90\u2019s til today men with a well groomed full beard are always much more respected compared to those with other beard styles. It is very easy to give credit and a trust to a man with a full beard simply because of the mature look that the style gives them. This\u00a0 is mainly due to the fact that a full beard makes you appear masculine and look quite older.\u00a0 Therefore,\u00a0 if you are in your teens stage, do not go in for a full beard; leave it for men in their late 30\u2019s and above. If you therefore feel that having respect from people is more important than looking super attractive to people around you then by all means you will fall in love with the full beard. For the best beard styles that require you to grow a full beard, you will also need to make use of beard grooming products and may be beard growth products in order to have you looking your best. Recommended: Beard Grooming Kit I know that the very first thing every one will notice about this good looking guy is his very beautiful, shiny and smooth hair but his beard style also has a lot to do with his gorgeous appearance. This style combines a mustache and full beard where hair along the jaws is trimmed shorter while on the chin it is left to grow.longer and thicker. This beard style above prominently features in the best beard styles for black men and may apply to those that have either short to no hair as well as long hair like dreadlocks. We have seen a lot of beard styles combined to come up with a unique and special but trust me, nothing beats the combination of a mustache paired with a goatee. If you have a round face shape, there is a way the goatee helps to bring a longer appearance and at the same time gives you that masculine look that you would like to have. Recommended Products from Amazon TRYM II \u2013 The Rechargeable Modern Hair Clipper Kit \u2013 Ultra-Sleek Hair, Body, Mustache, this trimmer is designed with professional grade blades that can easily create any style that you may want to create.

Latest Beard styles for Men \u2013 Best Short Beard Styles for Men These beard styles will give you that super modern and sophisticated look because they are some of the most current ones. You may not be a movie star, musician or celebrity for that matter but one thing that is for sure is the fact that everyone at one point in life loves to stand out. And what better way to grab attention than to wear that really trendy and up to date beard style. Here are some modern\u00a0 beard styles for white men that will make you look like the star that you have always wanted to be. When we talk about the latest beard styles we cannot leave out this beard combined with stubble, I simply love how it makes the guy wearing it in the image manly and all mature. I would not recommend this beard style to a guy in their 20s but if you are in your 40s and above that you will definitely rock it nicely. The style features cheeks and jawline covered up in a beard that is not so long but it longer than stubble, more like a two to three weeks beard. From just below the lower lip and down to the chin, hair is much shorter trimmed to stubble length. Leaving the neck line with hair in this case was such a great decision as it matched well with the style he is wearing. I doubt such a beard would look nice with a clean neckline and with his hair all pulled and smoothed behind and away from the face, the beard style is left with a lot of space to stand out. This length of facial hair can get really irritating as it badly itches the skin but the Black Beard\u2019s Pride Beard & Mustache Balm, Leave-in Hair and Skin Conditioner is the perfect solution to that. It also goes further to make your beard look attractively shiny. Of late one of the latest beard styles is this light beard which looks more like a full beard but it is not that thick. For men that want to grow a full beard for the first time or those whose hair grows at slow pace will find easier starting with this light beard. It is stylish with hair growing out from the side, along the jawline and below the chin. Above the upper lip you will find some hair as well but the neck line is left completely clean. The number one reason as to why this beard style becomes more and more popular every other day is the fact that it can be both a formal or informal look that is to say a sportsman can confidently wear the style as well as the very busy office guy. Invest in one of the best beard trimmers to maintain the beard to perfect length. To tame your beard and make it look attractive, the Beard Balm \u2013 All Natural Easy-to-Use Leave-in Beard Conditioner \u2013 Handmade in Detroit \u2013 Original Scent will absolutely be at your service so do not be hesitant to try it out. Recommended: Beard Grooming Kit If you really want to standout just like the star on our last image of the best beard styles for whit men then you will love every bit if this long goatee designed with a mustache. On thing that I always tell guys who love the goatee is that this style will give you the chance to take it on without entirely giving up on you former style. In particular I love this long goatee because of the its unique length, it is very rare that you will find someone growing their goatee to this length hence making the style very outstanding. Secondly it is detailed with blonde and brown which is a very perfect shade for his white skin. Oh and I cannot possibly forget to mention how great the dark brown hair looks on his\u00a0 skin. To make goatee styling a routine that will not take all day but one that comes up with the perfect results do not hesitate going in for the Goatee Saver \u2013 The Goatee Shaving Template. It is designed to make styling the goatee one of the easiest tasks you will ever have to do. Creating this goatee: Grow a full beard: in order to have the perfect goatee, you must first of all grow your beard into a full one so that it becomes easy for you to shape out your goatee. The mere fact that this is a long a goatee you must let your beard grow to a really long length. Decide which length you want: not every face shape will look good with such a long goatee, therefore I would only recommend that round and square shape faces to go in for this look. If your face shape in long such a long goatee will make your face appear even much longer. Outline your goatee: the outline of your goatee will depend on how you want to style your beard for example in thing image he style his goatee with a mustache so make sure to outline the goatee hand in hand with the mustache. Cleanly shave the cheeks: use a safety razor as it will be easier for you to control so that you do not cut into your style and spoil it. Wash your face to finish: use cold water to wash your face so as to help close skin pores and soothe the skin. Recommended: Beard Grooming Kits French Beard styles for Men With the rate at which French beard styles are getting popular, you should probably be thinking about giving them a shot.\u00a0 They come\u00a0 in different fashions all of which can be worn to a variety of occasion and with different outfits, which means no matter what your life style might be you will still find the perfect French beard style to try on. The style of the French beard is designed with a mustache and large soul patch where hair runs from just below the lower lip and chains up into the goatee. The cheeks and neckline are left completely smooth and clean giving him that formal and serious guy appearance. Another way in which you can wear the French beard style is without the soul patch but with a goatee and mustache. This works mainly for guys jaws that are not so curved so the squared jaws might be left out on this one. Recommended: Beard Grooming Kit Best beard styles for\u00a0 Men with Round Face or Oval Face Men with round faces usually find it confusing to choose the perfect beard style for their face shape. Most people will agree that having a full and long beard gives their round face shape a broader appearance. This however, is not that the case for a simple full beard which instead makes a round face appear more round and wide which is not what you are looking for. Round faces look best with a goatee as it adds up to the length of your face. The Stubble beard makes your round face appear narrower or even the clean that leaves your face just the way it is. So if you have a round face shape you can try out the beard styles to make sure you do not do anything that will give you the wrong look. A Stubble beard with a thin mustache beard gives a round face shape the perfect face shape reason being it does not increase how wide it appears and with some hair on the chin your face will have a longer appearance. Stubble is left along the jaws down to the neckline and some on above the upper lip. The rest of his face is shaved to allow his neat stubble to stand out and we also love how stubble is only left on a small part of the neckline. If you have a round face or oval face shape and in your 40\u2019s, I can assure you that there no way you will go wrong with this stubble beard style. Achieving the perfect stubble requires a great quality trimmer with a variety of length settings to be able to trim your beard to the most ideal length. Top rated Beard Trimmers Wahl 9867 Lithium Ion Beard and Stubble Trimmer. Philips Norelco Beard Trimmer 3500, cordless with adjustable length settings How to maintain the stubble beard style; Know when to trim your beard: depending on how fast your hair grows; it is a must to trim your beard every after three to five days. I f you leave stubble without trimming it for more than five days then you will definitely not be growing stubble but a beard. Have the right tools: number one tool for maintaining your stubble is having a really quality trimmer with various length settings. Such a trimmer will help you to easily trim your stubble to the length you want it to. Create boundaries: with stubble hair can easily go astray, therefore you need to know where lines and edges should stop. Endeavor to keep the boundaries looking very neat by cutting away stray hairs. Wash and rinse our stubble regularly: if you have grown stubble before then you must know how itchy it can really get therefore try as much as possible to wash your face on daily basis and often deep clean to get rid of dead skin and dandruff that makes your beard itchy. Now the other way you will never go wrong with your round face (oval face) is by going in for the clean shave. This is not just effortless but also saves on a lot of guess work that you have to do when looking out for the perfect beard style. The clean\u00a0 beard shave leaves you round face just the way it is which makes it a much simple style than all the rest. In the image we can see that the hairstyle is wearing adds such a stylish appearance to his clean shave as it prevents the style from looking too boring. It is actually his hairstyle helping to add some length to his round face shape reason being it is cut shorter on the sides yet hair in the middle is left longer. At any age or any function, you can always feel free to rock the clean shave since it is classy and never runs out of trend. If you plan on having that close shave with no irritation at all, try using the Panasonic ES-LV95-S Arc5 Wet & Dry Shaver with Cleaning and Charging System. Top rated Shavers on Amazon Gillette Fusion Pro-Glide Manual Men\u2019s Razor Blade Refills Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor Edwin Jagger De89lbl Lined Detail Chrome Plated Double Edge Safety Razor This is how you can get the perfect clean shave just like the one he is wearing: Prepare well for the process; this involves checking whether your shaver is sharp enough or if it is fully charged and if not then endeavor to charge it first. Choose the shave you want; if you are in a hurry the dry shave will be a perfect choice and when you have time and are scared for your sensitive skin then probably the wet shave will be more soothing. Wash and rinse your face prior to the shaving process so that sweat and dirt coming from the skin does not clog your shaver. Begin shaving while tightly stretching the skin so that shave can come really close to skin but do not press the shaver too firm on to your skin. Finish up by rinsing the face with cold water and applying some aftershave or a moisturizer. Recommended: Beard Grooming Kit Best Beard Style for Shaved Heads \u2013 Beard Styles for Bald Men Bald guys are also looked at as the sexy, manly and really confident with their style. There are several reasons as to why I would advise any guy to go in for the bald head and with the main one being having a tidy look every time. With your shaved head you are never worried about styling or hair flying away to spoil your smart look and you stay looking smart all day long. And in those extremely hot conditions you remain very comfortable without the irritating sweat that others with hair are going through. If you are in for shaved head, here are some really good looking guys that will inspire on taking up the bald look. Going bald has nothing to do with your age, \u00a0some younger men look exquisite with \u00a0shaved heads and now we come to this older guy who still kills it on the same look. The only difference is that with this current picture is wearing an entirely \u00a0shaved head look with not even one-inch hair left. It looks good with his long face shape and when it comes to styling it will much easier and less time wasting. Once you have the shaver that can that close you will definitely be able to get yourself this awesome look. I would recommend this \u00a0beard style to any guy in his 40\u2019s or above that because it requires very little maintenance and at that age you don\u2019t need a cut that will make you spend a whole day in the mirror. In addition, he is rocking a mustache which we all know is a favorite for men in his age bracket and since he has a clean shaven head and beard, I absolutely love the way anyone would easily notice his mustache even from a distance. Nothing will ever beat safety razors when it comes to giving that super close shave therefore if you are looking forward to having the cleanest and closest shave then do not think twice about trying out the Edwin Jagger DE89Lbl Lined Detail Chrome Plated Double Edge Safety Razor Every guy has a different face shape but one thing about shaved heads is that anyone can go in for them though you must choose the best beard style to make a shaved head look good on you. With a shaved head you must keep in mind that your beard will greatly stand out so you must be very careful while choosing the perfect beard style to match with shaved head as well as your face shape. Having the perfect beard means the beard should perfectly frame your jaws. If you are by any chance thinking about having a shaved head then here are some tips that you can follow depending on what face shape you have in order to turn heads with your shaved head. And then comes the long face shape with a shaved head, you must know that having a long face shape and going in for a shaved head will make every notice its length which means you will have to look out for a beard style that will cut down on how long your face is. Thick side burns with stubble surely worked for him as we can clearly spot in the above image. Some people actually say that stubble does not look good next to side burns but from what I see now I can clearly say they were wrong because he looks really fine. The way he styled his beard together with the super clean and shiny shaved head gives him that flawless appearance that just any man would really like to have. And with the way stubble is becoming extremely popular these days you will surely not go wrong on this one. Recommended: Beard Grooming Kit Best Beard Styles for Men with Short Hair/ Thin Hair The square shaped faces tend to have very outlined jaws therefore the perfect beard style to go with a shaved head or short hair on square face will be either a clean shave or a goatee. Reason being it does not increase the width of your jaws but simply prevent them from growing out further to the sides. Such faces need beard styles with more hair around the chin and little or no hair on the jaws, in this image we just love how his square jaws stand with no hair at all. If you have \u00a0short hair\u00a0with one inch hair left then try out the clean shave, it will be a good choice for you. These beard styles could also work well with most black men. Round face shapes are simple the opposite of long face shapes because for them, you will need that style that makes your round face gain some length and appear longer than it is. Round face shapes appear best with beard styles that have longer hair on the chin but shorter hair on the sides. The round face shapes guy features on this image has short hair where by the sides are shorter and slightly long hair on top of the head. And moving on to his beard, it is a well groomed stubble\u00a0on the jaws that is later detailed with a thin mustache. The beard nicely angles his face enabling us to notice the perfect combination between his beard style and shaved head. Just like all the other face shapes we have just looked with short hair, the triangular face also stands out much more when your head is shaved. He chose to have his shaved head accompanied with very short stubble which is by the way very stylish. I would recommend this look for the white men out there who are into sports as this is a really cool sportsman look. Along the jaws we can spot some stubble but it is very thing while on the chin it is quite thick, there is also some hair just below his upper lip. A clean neck line together with clean shaven cheeks makes his style look really perfect. One thing that really makes love the bald look more and more every other time is the fact that it does not discriminate when it comes to age anyone can go in for this look whether you are in your teens, your 30s or even older than that. In the image above, the guy we spot is rocking a bald style but with some little hair left, this is style is best if you are doing the bald style or the first time as it helps you get some more of confidence and allows you to get used to the look. The guy has a heart shaped face and there is no doubt the style looks amazing on him, you can wear this look to work, to a friend\u2019s wedding, or even to the cinema with your partner. With absolutely no effort required his bald look can take you a variety of places and make your really outstanding. The BRAUN SERIES 7 799CC-6WD CC4 Wet & Dry Shaver is that one product that you must be looking out for because it is such a handy tool that will help you maintain you gorgeous look every single day. Stubble Beard Style for Men with Short Hair For any\u00a0 man that cannot stand the hardship of waiting for the beard to grow extremely long yet at the same time would not want to completely shave it away this is a really great example that you can take from. His length of stubble is quite long and very thick making us draw a lot of attention to the white skin that he has. I love the fact that his neck line is left super clean, it simply helps us to notice how his stubble stands out. Achieving this length of stubble might not be that easy but hey, you will definitely love the results as everyone will give you lots of compliments on how you manage to keep your stubble that perfect. From the cheeks, along the jawline below the lower lip and even below the nose, all his facial hair was cut to the same look. the Wahl 9867 Lithium Ion Beard and Stubble Trimmer with its 7 position hair comb will give you the best stubble ever,because this number of length settings makes it easy for you to trim your hair to your favorite length. Tips: Invest in trimmer with length settings, there is no way you can get the perfect stubble if your trimmer does not allow you to trim to a certain length. Use a trimmer not s shaver or if you must you use a shaver; it must have a beard trimmer attachment. Always shave the neckline completely clean, stubble only looks smart with a clean shaven neck. As problematic as it may be for you to shave along the neckline; take your time to perfectly shave off all the hair.

The drill here is the same. We\u2019ve picked five Division I national title winners from the annals of men\u2019s soccer history that we\u2019ve knighted as the best of all time. I\u2019ll unveil two men\u2019s teams today and three more on Tuesday before opening the floor for voting on Wednesday. We\u2019ll leave that open through the men\u2019s College Cup this weekend and unveil our winner on Monday. With that in mind, into the fray we go. The five best DI men\u2019s soccer national title winners of all time. 2010 Akron Zips How they finished: 22-1-2, defeated Louisville 1-0 in the national title game Key players: F Darren Mattocks, F Darlington Nagbe, M Perry Kitchen, M Michael Nanchoff, M Scott Caldwell, D Kofi Sarkodie, D Zarek Valentin Why they\u2019re the best: The 2010 Akron team is a true mutant beast, proof that things really do come together perfectly once in a blue moon. The Zips\u2019 2010 starting XI is perhaps the only one in college history that had a shot at being reunited as a competitive professional side. The creative juice provided by Darlington Nagbe, the pure athleticism up top from Darren Mattocks, the graft of Zarek Valentin and Kofi Sarkodie and the engine from Michael Nanchoff and Perry Kitchen\u2026 the talent here boggles the mind. Don\u2019t forget the man behind it all; Caleb Porter, the luminary who went on to win the MLS Coach of the Year award in 2013 in his first year in the league. Before his professional leap, he was busy importing his Death By 1,000 Passes to college soccer via the Zips. Porter did as much to change the boot-and-chase paradigm that pervaded college soccer as anyone. Watching his Akron teams were always a joy, but the 2010 team was something else entirely. You knew you were watching history. After the season, five Akron underclassmen signed Generation adidas contracts to enter the MLS SuperDraft. That\u2019s unprecedented, and it\u2019ll be a small shock if it ever happens again. As if to head off MAC detractors, Akron beat North Carolina and Wake Forest in the regular season before going on an unforgettably difficult NCAA run. A 3-2 win over West Virginia. A 2-1 win over Indiana. Penalties over California and a 2-1 win over Michigan before Louisville in the title game. Appropriately, Caldwell punched in the winner in the 79th minute to clinch Akron\u2019s first and only title. Just look at the talent on offer here. Finding a better college team than this might be a tough ask. Fun video: Visible evidence of Porter\u2019s astounding 2010 team. Beautiful passing networks, uncanny vision and pleasing aesthetics. This is the way soccer is supposed to look. 1997 UCLA How they finished: 22-2-0, defeated Virginia 2-0 in the national title game Key players: F Seth George, F McKinley Tennyson, M Pete Vagenas, M Sasha Victorine, D Jimmy Conrad, D Carlos Bocanegra, GK Matt Reis Why they\u2019re the best: UCLA certainly went through the ringer to earn its third NCAA title in 1997. The Bruins bested 23-0-0 and No. 1 overall seed Indiana 1-0 in the tournament semis and eventually had to go through Virginia, the team of the 90\u2019s, to win the title. It\u2019s incredible to think that in 1997, Nick Rimando was sitting on the bench behind Matt Reis, both of whom went on to outstanding MLS careers between the pipes. Just a glimpse at the gold UCLA had in its coffers that season. With Jimmy Conrad and Carlos Bocanegra shoring up the defense and Reis patrolling the goalmouth, UCLA\u2019s defense in 1997 was formidable. Reis tied the school record in the final by making 11 saves on 25 shots, and a then-freshman Bocanegra was an easy choice as a freshman All-American. He also had a killer middle part hair style and a rocking 90\u2019s goatee. Hard to beat. Seth George led the front line with 16 goals in 1997 and was an easy outlet as the surest scoring threat on the team. He ended up taking home the final four offensive MVP trophy. This was future professional boss Sigi Schmid\u2019s 17th season in Westwood, and he\u2019d only coach two more before jumping to the LA Galaxy. And it might have been his best coaching job of the lot. UCLA was missing midfield stalwarts Pete Vagenas and Sasha Victorine for the final against Virginia, forcing the onus on players like Ryan Lee and Steve Shak. The Bruins were up to the task and managed to stake their claim as arguably the best of UCLA\u2019s four title-winning sides.

I've had mine since the 80s, when they weren't so popular (but when I became intelligent enough to realize that doing something because it is \"popular\" is a sign of ignorance and a lack of creativity).Then they became popular, and I was tempted to shave it off because I'd hate for people to think I was just following a trend. Goddamn yuppies filth, always following me, and making me look like I'm just some kind of dumb fuck trend follower. Like the cigar craze - I was into cigars, and loving them, then the yuppie filth decided that cigars were \"in\", and theprices skyrocketed and priced me right out of them. Of course, once their shitass ignorant attention span left cigars, the prices came down and now I'm back to smoking them again.Goddamn yuppie fuck filth.But I still wear the goatee, because that's how I look best, so, yuppie trendy filth be damned, I'll continue to wear them. And then, five years from now, some asshole who today would say \"Goatees are the best style ever! They rock! Cool people have goatess!\" will be saying \"Goatees are ugly, they're dumb, they're stupid looking\".sstupid fucking asshole shitknocking filthfucker gonad-eating clueless artless \"I have no sense of myself as an individuated entity\" idiots.

If I get used to someone sporting one it becomes a part of their look and starts to work on them even if it didn't seem to before. I guess that's true of most things about someone's appearance.In general I think full beards are a cooler look. I think if someone can grow a full beard they should go for that rather than just the goatee/mustache combo.

I could never get mine to look as perfectly thin and neat as Craig David's, but that didn't stop me from desperately\u00a0trying to look like a reject from a '90's boy-band.\u00a0\u00a0I apologize if\u00a0you have Color Me Badd's\u00a0\"I Wanna Sex You Up\" stuck in\u00a0your head now...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I don't\u00a0think I need to go into much detail here. These exquisitely fancy whiskers were favored by '70's porn stars (or so I hear) and former NFL quarterback Jake Plummer. You may remember this\u00a0beard from\u00a0the time I attempted (and failed) to get out of jury duty in April.\u00a0 I cleaned it up a little, and it still makes me look like a shady homeless guy you wouldn't want to\u00a0come across\u00a0in a dark alley (or Jack Shephard during his dark period).\u00a0\u00a0The original inspiration, of course, came from\u00a0Sly Stallone\u00a0during the\u00a0epic training montage\u00a0in Rocky IV. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to Michelle, I look like a sleazy car salesman with the goatee.\u00a0 I can't really argue with that, though I think the Elvis sideburns make me look a little more gangsta.\u00a0 I only wish I'd taken a page out of Pollard's book and braided the chin. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wolverine of the X-Men was my favorite comic book character as a kid, so naturally, I'd grow out mutton chops as an adult.\u00a0 Admit it -- you're jealous.

Facebook Instagram Follow on Instagram Home/Beard Grooming/A Century of Men\u2019s Grooming Trends in 90 Seconds View Larger Image A Century of Men\u2019s Grooming Trends in 90 Seconds Beard lovers know more than anyone that what goes around, comes around. As times change, one thing\u2019s for sure \u2013 beards will always be in style, and so will good beard care. To show us just how fleeting contemporary grooming styles can be, WatchCut Video just released a time lapse men\u2019s grooming makeover tracing facial and hair grooming styles from the 1910\u2019s through the 2010\u2019s. Can you guess what the 2010\u2019s guy looks like? We\u2019ll give you a hint \u2013 it rhymes with ban mun. First, check out the whole video here, then we\u2019ll dig in: Most of the styles came from men\u2019s grooming ads and old commercials. The video starts off with one of the least likely trends to return \u2013 greasy slicked back hair and a handlebar mustache. WatchCut Video via Youtube.com Handlebar mustaches are great, but I\u2019m not sure anyone would be able to trust a guy rocking this combo. If I\u2019m wrong, please tell me. Better yet, show me. Let\u2019s see you rocking this slick look and I\u2019ll tell you if I think I could drive away from your car dealership thinking I got a good deal. Right around this time, men began to shave a little closer because this is when bacteria was first discovered, and beards started to get a bit of a dirty reputation. You\u2019ll see in the video that for several decades, long beards stepped aside to make room for more styled mustaches and clean chins. This was also the time that the last American president to wear facial hair, William H. Taft, curled up the ends of his famous mustache. The early aughts signaled the end of a wild time for beards and mustaches, which included mutton chop side burns and\u00a0the glorious mane-like neckbeard made fashionable by Horace Greeley: Before World War II started, the toothbrush mustache was all the rage, as demonstrated by Charlie Chaplin and another sorta awful guy you might have heard of, which explains why it went out of fashion just as quickly. Instead of featuring the Hitler \u2018stache, this video chose instead to feature the Clark Gable look, or as some of you may know it better, the George Clooney Dapper Dan look in Oh Brother Where Art Thou. The hair was more sculpted than slicked back, and the mustache was becoming more thin, quickly approaching the 1940\u2019s pencil look. Frankly doesn\u2019t give a damn This video took the famous sailor kiss as inspiration for the 1940\u2019s look, which is completely clean shaven. Some men like Walt Disney kept their pencil mustaches, but beards were pretty hard to come by at this point. As the pop culture pendulum started to swing back, beards started to reappear with the beatniks of the late 50\u2019s. Be the first beatnik on the block. The 1950\u2019s was also the first time in the 20th century we see the resurgence of the goatee, which had a few different heydays throughout history. Abraham Lincoln had a goatee in the last few months of his presidency, the Greek demi-god Pan had one, and so did Shakespeare. Possibly the most famous goatee wearer, however, is Satan, which gives the goatee a pretty bad reputation. So it goes. In a study done by the University of Warwick, it was first found that the human mind perceives downward facing triangles as evil, and also found that goatees make men\u2019s faces look like downward facing triangles \u2013 yet another reason for the goatee\u2019s bad shake. Fortunately, the negative association hasn\u2019t stopped the ebbing and flowing of the style\u2019s popularity. By the 1970\u2019s, things started to get a little more wild and natural. Don\u2019t Haight it Besides general hairiness being considered sexy, the wild and wooley mustache trend of the late 1800\u2019s came back with a vengeance. Think Freddie Mercury and John Lennon, and of course, Tom Selleck, whose mustache has bridged facial hair divides of the 70\u2019s, 80\u2019s, and 90\u2019s. Chest hair is king Tom\u2019s mustache is actually called a chevron \u2018stache, and it launched a thousand imitations in the early 80\u2019s. Also popular during this time was the horseshoe mustache, which you might better know as the porn \u2018stache. In my personal opinion, most beard looks from the 1990\u2019s on up until the present are all still pretty acceptable, especially the Dave Grohl look that\u2019s featured in the video. The exception would be the boy band look, most notably whatever this is, which to me looks a little bit like a thong: It\u2019s been a loooooong century of majestic beards that are equal parts silly and revolutionary \u2013 we\u2019re just glad that beards of all types, old and new, aren\u2019t going anywhere anytime soon. As a comparison of beard styles throughout the 20th century, check out episode 2 of USA men\u2019s hairstyles, this time focusing on African American grooming trends. Which era does your look come from? Which out-of-style look is poised for a comeback? (I vote mutton chops).\u00a0Add more to this story in the comments. Bill Murray loves mutton.

As a woman, it took me a while to take in the large-scale beauty of Mr. Passion's beard. \u00a0Certainly, as co-founder of this blog, I love facial hair of all shapes and sizes, but this got me to thinking.... what if... what *IF* your significant other wasn't down with your facial hair? Jack:\u00a0Your partner needs to understand where you're coming from and what this process can mean to a man. S/he is seeing the beginning stages and maybe cringing, but you're seeing the potential.\u00a0 It takes a little time before the beard starts looking how you want it. \u00a0But if you're close with your partner and if you support one another, s/he will be there for the bad - before it gets good.\u00a0 You could also just ask him or her if they love you... and follow it directly by saying - #PROVEIT! I am sure eating gets in the way with a beard that size. \u00a0Am I wrong? Jack:\u00a0It's only the mustache that makes eating difficult. \u00a0I keep mine trimmed, and I know guys who just manage.\u00a0 If you can't handle the heat, get out the kitchen.\u00a0 Sacrifices must be made in the path to legendary greatness. How do you manage that mane? \u00a0Do you comb it? \u00a0Do you hire someone to handle it? Jack:\u00a0I use a comb, but only because my beard is long.\u00a0 You don't have to buy into the hype and get a really expensive comb, but just don't use a plastic one.\u00a0 Avoid seams because seams snag.\u00a0 Bakelite is cheap, easy, and readily available.\u00a0 However, most guys only need a quality boar bristle brush to distribute oils and stimulate the face underneath. And what about the men who have patchy beards? \u00a0Any advice? \u00a0Jack:\u00a0A lot of men's faces don't fill out 'til much later in their life.\u00a0 Despite evidence that men peak sexually in their early 20s, they might not get a full beard until their 40s.\u00a0 Rock what you've got.\u00a0 So what if you've a patchy beard?\u00a0 Nobody's going to know that because your mustache (or sideburns, or goatee, or whatever) looks so fresh. *Build-a-Beard founders hanging with Passion. tagged Bakelite, Jack Passion, beards, combs, legends, man, myth Share Article | Email Article | Permalink | Comments Off | Mon, May 3, 2010 2:57PM 10 Qs with (THE) Jack\u00a0Passion May 3, 2010 at 2:57PM | By El Beardo No doubt you\u2019ve heard the name\u2026 it rolls of your tongue like the feel of a cool breeze going through your beard on a hot summer day. Jack Passion (http://jackpassion.com and @jackpassion)\u2026 say it with us\u2026 Jack, Passion\u2026 yes, the very same that has amassed two wins in the Natural Beard category at World Beard and Mustache Championships at the age of 25\u2026 yep, that author who tackled beards chin on with The Facial Hair Handbook the must have beard growers book\u2026 the very same Jack Passion that signs his emails \u201cLove and Passion\u201d\u2026 people like that just warm our heart\u2026and yes, the very same with a giant orange beard. \u201cJack Passion is to the sport of bearding what Tiger Woods is to the sport of golf.\u201d \u2014 Phil Olsen, Founder and Self-Appointed Captain, Beard Team USA B-a-B edit: Written on 5/29/2009\u2026 yes, that matters. We try to be inspiring here at B-a-B, but truth be told we like nothing else than being inspired by the bearded community as well\u2026 Clearly, Jack is in a league all his own in terms of inspiration; Jack even was one of his graduating class\u2019 speakers at UCSC among other things\u2026 we should probably continue writing up this interview while bowing our heads, and you should probably read it as such as well. Either way, when we heard that Jack wasn\u2019t competing in the 2011 World Championships we raced to meet this bass playing beard oracle to get some answers and gauge what this means for competitive bearding, do German\u2019s cry, what the end of Street Fighter II looks like and much, much more\u2026 so, enjoy! It\u2019s an honor to be here by the side of such a beardo\u2026 your follicle awesomeness is an example to us all\u2026 how and when did you decide to grow it out and grow it proud? The honor is mine!\u00a0 I never gave bearding much thought until I placed highly on the world stage.\u00a0 Prior to that, my beard was just another in a long line of facial hairstyles that I had worn.\u00a0 At some point, I had no choice but to accept my role as America's beard ambassador; the alternative would have been to shave - no thanks!\u00a0 Since that time, a great deal of thought and discussion has brought me and my beard to where we are today.\u00a0 My beard is my career, and I work hard. When did the decision to participate in competitive bearding come to be? And why, how\u2019d you even hear about Beard Team USA? Initially, I just wanted a story to tell my grandchildren one day.\u00a0 I did not know the caliber of my beard, nor did I even know a fire burned in my heart to crush other men's dreams of bearded glory. Sometimes the spirit of competition must be awakened in the soul, like the premise of any good 80s action sports movie.\u00a0 I heeded the call to brush and condition my way to the top, a position from which I can hopefully lead by example that a bearded life is an authentic, honest, and honorable one. Tell us about your first competition on the global level \u2026 did other beardos give you a hard time because some of their beards were older than you? The first world competition I attended was in Berlin, and I \"only\" got third.\u00a0 There was quite a bit of outrage, but since it was in German, I had no idea.\u00a0 Later on, I was told that the older, German elite thought I was totally un-serious and that my pirate costume was disrespectful.\u00a0 They don't have to like me, as long as they fear me. My world standings are as follows: 2005, Berlin, 3rd place, Natural Full Beard 2007, Brighton, 1st place, Natural Full Beard 2009, Anchorage, 1st place, Natural Full Beard We know that people love the beard\u2026 did having a few titles help to milk even more love from envious women (and scores of men)? Yes.\u00a0 ;-) Nice, we dig\u2026 Anyway, then comes Alaska\u2026 you win that championship too\u2026 how\u2019d you do it? What is it about your routine that you think sets you apart? I spell out my entire regimen and all of my trade secrets in my book, The Facial Hair Handbook.\u00a0 My program is pretty simple in concept, but I actually follow all of it to a tee, and I am unrelenting in my pursuit of perfection -- no detail is to be overlooked. We will most certainly get to your hairy manuscript a bit later\u2026Why is the natural beard the most coveted title? Did the Germans cry like little babies after your 2nd win in a row? I don't know if there is one title more coveted than another, but Full Beard Natty is certainly the most competitive because of its size; more than half the competitors at the Anchorage contest were in my category. I don't know if they were crying, nor do I care.\u00a0 Nobody can hear their pitiful sobs over the roaring cheers of Passionate victory, anyway. Really though, everyone's a beardsman and after they warmed up to me, the Germans have always been really happy for me when I win.\u00a0 And if you've ever beaten Street Fighter II as Ryu, it's like that: I'm already on to the next match; I live for the thrill of the fight. Also, despite the sometimes (ok, often) inflammatory rhetoric, I grow and wear a beard for many reasons higher in priority than competition.\u00a0 I have made some men jealous, but if there is envy or rage, it is only because I have yet to connect with these guys on a personal level.\u00a0 If I have a beard and you have a beard, we have something in common of great social and moral significance; a bond that makes us real friends before we even meet. So now you are a two time champ, and yet you chose to not compete in the upcoming National Championships\u2026 what\u2019s the deal? Is winning THAT boring? I've logged the forest bare, and I need to let a few bearded trees grow again so that I can obliterate and tarnish their family names for all time once again. I've been a very prominent figure on the team, and since we're hosting it, I thought it'd just be a good move to sit it out.\u00a0 When I brought this up, the event planners offered the MC gig, and that's right up my alley, so I took it.\u00a0 I'm excited to relax and just have a good time with a bunch of good guys over a beautiful weekend in the Pacific Northwest, which to be fair, out-beards Brooklyn 10:1. I really encourage everyone in beards to come to Bend.\u00a0 It's super cheap to fly there, and this is not only your chance to do really well in a beard contest, but it's also shaping up to be the biggest facial hair event in history.\u00a0 Guinness will be on hand to record the number of contestants and spectators.\u00a0 Beard competitions are finally rising to the level of sports like World's Strongest Man and hot dog eating competitions.\u00a0 Anyone can do roids and get overpaid to play with balls.\u00a0 I say let's eat hot dogs, throw kegs over walls, and grow beards! We'll start booking our trip tomorrow! In the meantime, tell us about your book\u2026 is a sequel planned? Perhaps a guide to manscaping, or a tome about sideburns? Stache excellence? Do tell\u2026 and also, who is your favorite author? There is a lot of information on facial hair care in the world, but let's be honest:\u00a0 There's still a lot of shitty beards, and a lot of guys trying to grow beards end up quitting (and I say quitting instead of shaving, because it really is quitting; as in giving up, folding, submitting, and forfeiting) because it itches or someone tells them it sucks.\u00a0 I provide the motivation to go beards out, and the skill set to grow and wear facial hair to the best of your biological ability; in a practical and easy to follow format.\u00a0 Facial hair is an honest and natural thing, and I take a very holistic approach to equipping you with everything you need and nothing you don't.\u00a0 I know it sounds like a shameless plug, but it really will change a man's life. Plus, it makes a great gift. :) The book has done really well, and I'm just about to release a revised second printing.\u00a0 The content is almost identical, but some design things have changed, most notably the cover. I don't really have a favorite author, but I tend to read a lot of philosophy and other non-fiction if that helps. But when you ask about a favorite author, I have to ask, were you guys trying to get me to plug garyvee? Haha, thanks for that\u2026 but not since he shaved... You\u2019re an author and we figure you must be inspired by someone\u2026 bearded philosophers surely fit that bill.

It smells good, it's inexpensive in bulk, and it gets the job done well, but it's a age-old myth of the beard community that it's some miracle beard wash/condish.\u00a0 Beard hair isn't head hair, but it sure isn't horse hair, either!\u00a0 That said, if they offered me an endorsement, I'd take it.\u00a0 You can do better ($$$$), but you can do muuuch worse. tagged Beard Team USA, Jack Passion, Mane n\u2019Tail, Natural Beard, Phil Olsen, Street Fighter II, The Facial Hair Handbook, World Beard and Moustache Championships, beard, facial hair god, garyvee | in 10Qs, beard Share Article | Email Article | Permalink | 1 Comment | 8 References 9:58AM Party Tip: For The Moustache That You\u00a0Love May 3, 2010 at 9:58AM | By Riss Andrew W.K.\u00a0is throwing a 'stache party tonight at his den and all of New York City is encouraged to attend.\u00a0 \"For the Moustache That You Love\" is a\u00a0benefit for the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society that features Andrew W.K. on solo piano, Roadside Graves\u00a0(an incredible seven-piece ensemble),\u00a0the\u00a0Dirty Projectors' vocalist Angel Deradoorian, and Brooklyn's Mon Khmer\u00a0(a\u00a0Berklee-trained quintet, mind you).\u00a0 Doors are at 7:00 p.m. - tickets are $12.00 - purchase them HERE. tagged Andrew WK Share Article | Email Article | Permalink | Post a Comment | 1 Reference Thu, April 29, 2010 5:33PM Conan, B-a-B is with\u00a0you!

Well, I'm going where the water tastes like wine. We can jump in the water, stay drunk all the time...\"-- Going Up the CountryAs you likely know by now, we are huge fans of the bearded businesses, businessmen, products and technologies (would also have accepted: innovations, solutions, or initiatives)\u2026 That said, we support nearly any and all beardos and stache wearers with a story, we even stand chin to chin with some goatee wearers\u2026 but from time to time, a product comes along, that we would support with or without a bearded angle\u2026 one such amazing entity is FireFly Vodka.First a quick story\u2026As far as we are concerned, it was me (El Beardo) that discovered a sweet nectar of the gods called FireFly Sweet Tea Vodka for the NYC market a few years ago... While on a road trip to Charleston SC, my wife and I stumbled across a drink called 'The Carolina Cocktail' (aka FireFly sweet tea vodka, lemonade, ice with a dash of club soda)\u2026 at the time the young company wasn\u2019t exporting its distilled goodness across state lines\u2026 never being the ones to take no for an answer, we went to the closest liquor store in town and bought a case\u2026 which we proceeded to distribute to our friends in the NYC area\u2026 fast forward a year, and wham\u2026 FireFly was on the top of everyone\u2019s tongue, and swishing in all of our mouths. A legend was cemented \u2026now to resume our programming already in progress\u2026It should come as no surprise then why B-a-B asked the good folks at FireFly to sponsor of the 2010 Brooklyn Beard Ball\u2026 which they graciously did, by donating a full case of Sweat Tea Vodka to be flowing through our veins that one magic night in Greenpoint\u2026 to reinforce our perspective that everything can and should be connected back to facial hair, lo an behold, the founders of the distillery are BEARDOS (one ongoing, the other intermittent).So, when given the chance... it's needless to say I raced down from NYC back to Wadmalaw Island in South Carolina to sit down with co-founder, and a full time beardo (since 2007), Scott Newitt, for a chat about where booze and facial hair cross, and who exactly are straws made for\u2026 expectantly so, the day started and ended the same way, with a few John Daly\u2019s. 1) Tell us the history of Firefly... we've heard rumors of Kettle One defectors, secret recipes, unique distributors and much more... what's the real story of FireFly Sweet Tea Vodka (aka nectar of the gods)?My partner, Jim Irvin, \"Sometimes Bearded\" and myself, Scott Newitt, \"Always Bearded\" met in 2003. He is a winemaker and I was a Liquor/Wine Distributor. He hired me to represent his wines. We became friends and I showed him my still in 2003.We started Firefly Distillery in 2005 and made our first vodka out of his muscadine wine. We introduced the world's first Sweet Tea Vodka on April 15, 2008. He and I own the company and will not sell out to the big guys. We love what we do.Loving what they do... Co-founders Scott and Jim, with production manager Jay2) Does FireFly use American tea for the infusion? We know there is only one tea plantation in the US (surprisingly), if you do use them (or if you've just had their tea) how's the quality... can we take India and china on?We started off using only American Tea but as we grew we had to source outside the US. We still use tea from the Charleston Tea Plantation and are the only liquor company to get there tea. It is fantastic tea and indeed the only tea plantation in North America.3) How did the other flavors come around? How can we get on the focus group list...?I looked at flavors that were working for companies like Snapple. Their top 2 flavors are Peach and Raspberry and so are ours. WE will start checking out next year\u2019s flavors in October. Come on down.4) What is the best way to drink FireFly sweet tea vodka?I like it poured over crushed ice. I then let it melt for 2 min. Then drink! That is my favorite. The most popular drink is 1/2 Firefly and 1/2 Fresh Lemonade. Lots of folks call it \"The John Daily\"5) How long have you had your beard? How was the decision made?I have had a beard off and on for the last 20 years. In 2007, I decided to keep it. My wife likes me with a beard now. Honestly, I got tired of shaving every morning.6) Do you think this is 'The Year of the beard'? Have you been noticing more beardos around SC?I do think it is the Year of the beard. We have many beards in SC. Seems like the 21-29 age group has the most here.7) South Carolina recently had a beard and mustache championship regional event (held by the good folks of Holy City Beard & Moustache Society), did you go?I did not make it... I was out of town working and promoting Firefly.8) Who are some of the beardos that inspired you to grow yours out? mentors? idols?I love music and old TV shows... so, Willie Nelson is an inspiration as well as Uncle Jesse from The Dukes of Hazzard.9) What's the best way to drink a cocktail with a beard? Straws are a safe options, any other advice?Straws are for women and unbearded folks. Beards are designed to pick up drinks and food. I suggest drinking straight from the glass.10) What else do we need to know about you and your awesome distillery?I love music and have played the drums since 2nd grade. We just came out with Firefly Sweet Tea Bourbon. It is most definitely a Beard drink.Thanks for taking the time Scott, keep up the great work on the chin and in the bottle! Thanks and come visit!

So, here we are... and yes, while the post was great (see the compilation photo below and the link to the story) we will not stand idly by and wait for others to dictate their beardly decision to us!! So, before you peruse their findings (which are excerpted and abridged from The Language of the Beard, originally circulated by The Torchbearer Society, London, 1913... with Commentary by Gilbert Alter-Gilbert) and can be found at the bottom of our post... take a look at our Top-3 Poetic Beardos, and of course... they are part of our community! Judge for yourself... one of them even comes with his own poem! And speaking of Beardly poems... we found a nice batch of them: Derrick - Beard Poem, \u00a0Wallace Stevens - The Well Dressed Man With A Beard, and ghostwolf - Ballad of the Lost Beard. 1) Magnus Holmgren (aka @poetisk) -- We've known Magnus since almost the first day we went live on twitter... and have been trying to get him on B-a-B ever since. He tweets very interesting stuff, and frankly, his facial hair style is nearly unmatched... we love him so much we are willing to look past the New York Yankees hat (dude you're from Sweden, you MUST root for the Red Sox!) 2) Johnny Park (of The Oh Eeks)-- A lady friend of Johnny's got in touch with us about using the below shot... we were smitten rather immediately, but Johnny can thank our Facebook follower Rachel Commerford for this inclusion (even though your beard is rather nice), as we're not even sure that you're a follower of B-a-B... Rachel, you get a gold star. 3) Michael Sesling (aka @poeticmindset) -- We came to know Michael (who resides in my home town of Brookline MA) by way of Magnus... and his Haiku's lighten up our day from time to time. He's a great addition to the B-a-B family, but alas, this short beard will only get you as high up as #3... grow it out, grow it proud! ========================================================================= Poets Ranked by Beard Weight tagged Dissentertainer, Johnny Park, Magnus Holmgren, Michael Sesling, Rachel Commerford, beard weight, beards, poeticmindset, poetisk, poetry, poets, top 3 | in Facebook, Twitter, beard Share Article | Email Article | Permalink | Post a Comment | 9 References Thu, April 22, 2010 4:14PM 7-Eleven Appreciates Your Sweet\u00a0'Stache Apr 22, 2010 at 4:14PM | By Riss Even though 7-Eleven's goal is to \"consistently serve the changing needs of customers for\u00a0their\u00a0convenience\" - the law is the law & it is not convenient to be arrested.

I was headed to LaGuardia Airport just as I read a headline about flights to Canada being delayed or canceled because of the ash plume... I got worried for a second, I remember saying out loud \"NH is not that high up north...\" Heading to Manchester for a 30 hour business romp, I jumped in a cab, got through security and to the terminal in record time... now facing more than an hour at the gate before boarding... So, as always, I was scouting beards... While there were surprisingly many there that day, for some reason, I wasn't on my game... the blame has to be the rigid environment of airports and the overarching loathing of travel that would preclude me from approaching other high strung beardos... or we can just blame Eyjafjallajokull. That said, I did see a gent with an interesting and very neat beard style (thick but short trimmed side burns, with a twice as bushy goatee)... Finally, I get on the plane; a worn looking sucker with two propellers, with the landing gear that somehow folds in side them... Scary... Res ipsa loquitur\u2026 Let the good times roll. Upon landing in MHT, and making a B-line to the men's room, like clockwork I came across that very beardo! Clearly, the beard gods were making me tell him about B-a-B and comment on his awesome facial hair DIY... it worked before... so we get to talking, and lo and behold Mr. JD Wilson divulges the secret to his tidy bushiness... it's a product called MANE 'n TAIL... yes, as in horse. JD went on and on (about bees wax) and on and on (about mineral oils)... all to assure me that yes, while it's true this product was originally intended for horses, it does work wonders AND has a cult following, for HUMANS... all while we're standing in the men's room of the arrivals terminal. And so dear B-a-B fans, I'm proud to present my bounty of beard scouting from New Hampshire... Search and ye shall find... Per their own Facebook group info: Mane 'n Tail products were originally developed for horses. People started using the products to achieve the beautiful results they saw with their own horses manes and tails. This is where the legend of Mane n Tail products comes from, by nourishing, conditioning and fortifying the hair and scalp to aid healthier hair growth. Wow, seriously? Yes, for real... The sages have spoken, the truth is here, the follicles will rejoice...\u00a0 Bushy, itchy, medium length beards need this product, bad! You can get it here, and by clicking on the magic jar below... P.S. As hairy fate would have it, I had the seat right behind JD on the loud and bumpy ride up north. He was reading the whole time with the overhead light on, it was the right time to snap a candid... which I did, twice, not yet knowing the wisdom his beard was to hold.

Could this be the reason why so many hipsters in Brooklyn and the LES are sporting (and sprouting) beards lately? \u00a0The recession economy has forced many laid off workers to sit around and look longingly at their spouses... and what else is there really to do while you wait for your unemployment check to arrive? \u00a0The reason for this beard-growing phenomenon is apparently rooted in hormonal activities. Facial hair, a secondary male sexual characteristic, is largely governed by production of male hormones called androgens. Indeed, one of these compounds \u2014testosterone\u2014is known to be released in greater quantities during intercourse. \u00a0As such, there is also a release of androgens with the anticipation of sex - causing those who sport facial hair to have it grow leading up to the act of copulation. \u00a0You can read more about interesting man facts\u00a0here. \u00a0** Obviously waited a long time for some action ** tagged Brooklyn, Sex, androgens, beard growth Share Article | Email Article | Permalink | Post a Comment | 3 References Fri, April 16, 2010 12:17PM My Beowddd Hooytts Apr 16, 2010 at 12:17PM | By Riss No, we have not lost our minds over at B-a-B on this glorious Friday afternoon. \u00a0Rather, we fell in love AGAIN with - tagged 5 year olds, Zach Galifianakis, beards, hurts Share Article | Email Article | Permalink | Post a Comment | Tue, April 13, 2010 4:46PM Beard Economics: Paul Krugman in the\u00a0Right Apr 13, 2010 at 4:46PM | By El Beardo Earlier today I stumbled (by way of Riss and by @weareyourfek) on a Village Voice blog post (Shots Fired: New York Times Columnists Andrew Ross Sorkin and Paul Krugman's Beef Officially Cooked) which dissects a recent (and now ongoing) beef between New York Times staffers Andrew Ross Sorkin and Paul Krugman... the topic was nationalization of our banks... *yawn* we don't dive into politics as a priority at B-a-B (that's why Riss and I get along so well), but we wanted to throw our hat into the debate. The post goes on to describe the many and various shots fired from each camp, the supporting articles, countering experts, and a bunch of other financial and journalistic yadda yadda yadda jargon... for us though, the question is not whether Andrew mischaracterized Dr. Doom's (NYU's Nouriel Roubini) words, nor is it about what's the right move for the economy (though everyone should read: Hairy economy trend: Beards are back)... the question is simple: BEARD, or NO BEARD And the answer is even simpler! GO BEARD, or GO HOME We don't need to read articles upon articles, tap experts, talk about finance, examine global economy or even understand the Swede model for bank nationalization, to figure out at the end that Krugman is in the right (sorry for the spoiler)...

April and B-a-B founders have been friends ever since, and she even graced our presence at the Beard Ball Brooklyn (see below, surrounded by beardos... one of them being her hubby): April's genuine love for beards cannot be denied (even by her own words in a recent post titled 5 Things About My Love Life, loving a man with a beard is on the list)... So, it goes without saying that when April tells us to jump, we ask how high... And ask us to jump she did... this time for a blog group she's writing for called The Stir. Last week April sat Riss and I down for an interview about the beards from below, that is to say Manscaping... What resulted was an introspective look at the hairy theme, with our 'expertise' at the forefront... thank you for everyone who helped us with the post, your thoughts and points were well noted, and in some cases even used!

Ross Perot - Adam Lisagor Is Keeping His\u00a0Beard Apr 8, 2010 at 11:35AM | By Riss As promised, the second installment of our interview with Adam Lisagor\u00a0has posted for your bearded enjoyment.... Q: Do a lot of your friends have beards?\u00a0 How does corporate culture impact your bearded decision (or not)?Not many of my friends have beards, actually. And that may be for many reasons: their careers may preclude the option, their personal style may conflict with the ruggedness of a beard, but I think most often it's just that their sissy faces can't really support the follicular activity. Every time I have the beard conversation with a friend, it's always, \"Oh, I can grow hair here and here, but it never comes in here.\" And all I can feel is sad for them, the way my friends felt sad for me when I was 15 and hadn't yet sprouted in my crotch or armpits. I'm self-employed, and even if I weren't, I work in an industry that favors those who look like shit at all times (the sitting-in-front-of-a-computer industry). So I have no impetus to ditch it for the furthering of my career. I read once that as a CEO, H. Ross Perot actually forbade the wearing of beards among his male employees, which just strikes me as pure fascist bullshit and I'm glad he lost the election because I'M KEEPIN MY BEARD, H. ROSS.Also, at 32, I've sort of settled into my level of stockiness and girth. I wouldn't like to see what my bare cheeks look like at my current BMI. This is always a consideration for any bearded man. Q: What beard - throughout history - has inspired you?\u00a0 Do you have a bearded hero?I've always admired Stanley Kubrick's beard, because he always looked like he cared just enough to get dressed and trim his beard to avoid overgrowth, but that he had enough on his mind to keep him from caring too much. And I think our growth pattern is very similar, even on the head part of the beard, which I guess, is just called hair. My other bearded hero is this guy, and I don't know his name. The \"show me you're nuts\" guy from \"Kentucky Fried Movie\" (1977). It's the way guys in the 70s used to wear a beard\u2014just classy. Q: How do you feel about the current beard trend?\u00a0 Is this good for the movement? Do you feel there might be backlash?How do I feel about the current beard trend? It's fine, I guess. If all the beards went away tomorrow, I'd feel better about having mine. It never feels good to look like everybody else out there. I get so dismayed when I go to a party, or am out in public in a major city like LA, where I live, or Portland, where I go often, and see so many dudes that look just like me. It comes down to Freud's narcissism of small differences, where the more they look like me, the more reasons I have to find to distinguish myself from them and hate them. Like, \"Oh, that guy? His beard and glasses make him look so Jewy. Jew Jew Jew Jew JEWY JEW. [Note: I'm clearly Jewish, but there is no greater compliment to pay to a Jew than to tell him he doesn't look Jewish.]\" Sameness breeds a lot of hatred in counterculture. No one wants that. So I'd be fine if the trend took its leave.Q: Did you attend SXSWi?\u00a0 What did you think about the amount of beards that were there?I was there for Interactive, but honestly, I didn't notice. Again, I live in LA where beards abound, so there was nothing out of the ordinary about Austin during SXSW. Anything you'd like to tell us/share/link to?Today on putthison.com, the men's style show I do with my partner Jesse Thorn, Jesse did a post about facial hair options which I found pretty good. Someone wrote in to ask us about facial hair and Jesse fielded the question (since I don't really contribute to the blog, but Jesse does an amazing job), basically instructing the dude to avoid goatees at all cost, which is a solid piece of advice, for sure. I guess I've never asked my girlfriend of seven years, Roxana, how she feels about my beard, or whether she'd prefer me clean-shaven. I know for sure that it's better to be either clean-shaven or have a longer beard because a short beard or stubble is just irritating to the face of the person with whom you're necking, so that's a consideration. But she has a good sense of style, as the editor of the men's style site Nerd Boyfriend, and I trust that she'd tell me if I looked like a doofus.Adam's sweet beard & iJustine tagged Adam Lisagor, H.

Ross Perot, why chin-pads suck, to Freud's\u00a0narcissism of small differences),\u00a0this is going to be a\u00a0special two-part interview. One thing is for certain - Adam is serious about his beard. \u00a0Luckily, B-a-B is a firm believer that good things come to obsessive-compulsives who fixate.\u00a0Adam feels that \"beards are certainly in fashion, and there aren't any signs of that momentum slowing.\"\u00a0Here's a blog post he wrote\u00a0about his beard a couple years back, in response to a TIME article about their growing popularity.Below are a few topics that B-a-B was privileged to talk to Adam about.... \u00a0Part I Background (via Adam)In its current full-breaded state, my beard has been living with me since 2003. I had a girlfriend during college that was always encouraging me to grow a beard, and I'd experimented with facial hair configurations from the time I could get a patch of hair to coagulate on any spot of my face, but a beard always seemed too manly and, for lack of a better term, too\u00a0dad\u00a0for me. And I'm one of those adult males who was emotionally 17 for some time into his 20s, and then 23 until about the age of 30. So a beard was out of the question, at least until I was paying all of my own rent. The\u00a0Experiment,\u00a0Gilligan, & Jim Jarmusch My first experiment with facial hair was a small tuft on the point of my chin. A\u00a0Maynard G. Krebs, as I've always called it, after\u00a0Gilligan's beatnik character\u00a0from\u00a0The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis. Mind you, this wasn't a chin-pad, which is, was and always will be a mortal sin in the world of facial hair. This was a small patch which signified the wearer as a member of the counterculture in the 90s, when I wore it in my first year of college. I'd been a jazzbo, and the look suited me. A huge fan of Jim Jarmusch and his prematurely gray hair, I even attempted to dye mine gray at one point but I did it wrong and it hurt my face. Sideburns\u00a0Central, Luke Perry, & Training To Go Beard Next came sideburns. Real\u00a0Luke Perry\u00a0specials. Something every young man should try once, and certainly better than the other extreme, which is whitewalls, which is the anti-beard, and great if you want to look like you're most at home at a petting zoo or a Civil War museum. During and particularly after college, I smoked a lot of weed,\u00a0so\u00a0of course\u00a0I grew pork chops.\u00a0Pork chops are training ground for a full beard. And in 2001, beards weren't the rage as they are now. So I had to ease the world into my hairy face, or vice versa. The world had to ease me into my hairy face. Just look at the size of that J! The Dude Anyhow, as soon as I grew out of my unemployed post-college phase and joined the working world, it was time to try a beard out. And it worked for me. In the 80s, my dad always had a beard, and he looked pretty good.\u00a0As an adult, I look a lot like my dad, so I sort of think of him in the 80s whenever I see myself bearded. Now, he's done more of a van dyke (which I'm not a huge fan of unless you're The Dude) but it can look not bad on a distinguished older man.\u00a0Here's me, bearded, and my dad, van dyked. Remembering Your Face Every so often towards the beginning of my beard tenure, I'd have to shave it off to remember what my face looked like. See\u00a0this picture\u00a0for what my face looks like. But I hate to shave. I hate it. Even in a hot shower, it'd bug the shit out of me, so I'd just stop shaving. And I think that's where the beard mostly came from\u2014laziness. So in addition to signifying membership in a counterculture, it signifies laziness, which is most often part and parcel. Avoid Enhancing Fleshiness By now, at 32, I've gone at least 3 or 4 years without having done more than close-crop the beard, and I don't think I will shave it any time soon. My normal grooming regimen is about every two weeks, I'll pull out the Wahl and give it the once over with a #3 guard, and then a #2 and then clean up the neck area. But most important, MOST IMPORTANT, is to go gradually into a bare neck. Don't, under any circumstance, make a sharp edge at the bottom of your beard and leave that whole patch of under-jaw bare. Because it will enhance the fleshiness of your skin and make you look like a dork. In grade school, I'd always get A's on map making by feathering the borders of the land and the water. I apply this philosophy to my beard trimming and it hasn't failed me. Oh, and no chin-straps, fellas. No way, Jebediah. The Signature Beard & Shooting Lasers And my beard has, by this point, become my signature. My face is pretty easily maleable, and I have no problem changing my look, so I'm quite sure that many people wouldn't recognize me if I were to lose the beard. Likewise, my thick plastic frames. At some point, I'll get laser eye surgery (so I can shoot lasers from my eyes) and I'll no longer need glasses. But I'm quite sure that I'll still wear non-prescription frames because I like frames and they're sort of my trademark. To an obnoxious point, actually. I get a lot of \"Oh, here's a picture of a guy that looks just like you!\" and it'll just be some schlub with a beard and glasses, but an entirely dissimilar face. I'll make it clear here and now: knock that shit off, people. We are actual human beings under our beards and glasses, unique like snowflakes and unlike that analogy.

Max runs the popular blog 'Dissentertainer' -\u00a0dedicated to uncovering the hidden treasures of music, film, art and the culture at large. \u00a0More importantly, he sports one fine looking beard after experiencing some heartache (Note: I've known Max for years - and it's completely the girl's loss - he's a New York City\u00a0gem). Recently, we sat down over beers and discussed Max's hairy tale.... when his beard \"became a man,\" the experience of growing an epic Civil War-style beard, how beards are \"catnip for girls,\" and\u00a0how Max balances both his mod & lumberjack facial hair\u00a0styling.... BAB: How long were you dating and why did you choose to grow a beard after the relationship ended?\u00a0\u00a0 Max:\u00a0We dated for about a year, but I didn't give birth to the beard until a few months after we broke up. It was actually more of an \"accidental beard\" and didn't initially have anything to do with my ex, but I don't love it any less for being unplanned or conceived out of wedlock. BAB: Did the post break-up beard start as a mustache and grow into a beard - or did you decide to go all out?\u00a0 Was it a conscious decision?\u00a0 Max:\u00a0I grew the beard as a form of self-defense. At first it was just some light scruff that I was sporting after a particularly lazy Labor Day weekend. I was a few weeks away from my 30th birthday and facial hair seemed like a really grown-up thing that I had never tried, so I decided not to shave for the rest of the month. A few days into the experiment, I let the ex-girlfriend in question take a shower at my apartment while I was at work because she had been sleeping at her office and needed to clean herself up before visiting apartments that night. I told her to be gone by the time I got home and to leave her set of keys behind, but of course she was there upon my return. \u00a0Further, when I got back to the apt, she didn't want to leave. When I insisted that she leave she got a little crazy and a little violent (note to self: don't leave box cutters around the house), so I decided to take an evening stroll to the local police precinct. She was gone by the time I got back, but the next morning I noticed that my underwear felt a little breezier than normal and discovered a gaping hole that had been slashed in the crotch. She had apparently used my time at the precinct - to not only cut up most of my clothes - but also to fold and hang them up perfectly so I would discover a little bit more of her \"crazy\" each and every morning.\u00a0\u00a0That was the day my beard became a man.\u00a0 I abandoned my plan to shave it and decided to wear it as a disguise instead. BAB: Did your ex see you with\u00a0a beard\u00a0weeks or years later\u00a0- did she have any comments (good or bad)? Max:\u00a0She may have seen a photo online because she was\u00a0cyber stalking\u00a0me for a good three months after that, but she never saw it in person. I'm sure she would have hated it because she would have understood the meaning behind it.\u00a0It wasn't until I grew the beard that I also grew the balls to finally change my\u00a0phone\u00a0number and excommunicate her permanently from my consciousness. BAB: How long have you rocked a beard since this relationship ended?\u00a0 Max: I kept it for about a year, but eventually had to shave it off for a show. It's hard to maintain a consistent beard as an actor unless you have branded yourself as a\u00a0beardo, but once in a while you get to really go for it. Last year I grew out an epic Civil War-style beard for a show based on a Faulkner novel. I felt like I got to know my beard in a new light. BAB: Will you keep growing it?\u00a0 Why? Max: My mod side and my lumberjack side are still fighting this one out, but shaving is a pain in the ass. \u00a0Besides, beards are catnip for girls so I don't see myself going clean anytime soon. BAB: What does your beard mean to you? Max:\u00a0My father sported a super manly beard when I was a kid, but shaved it off recently, so my beard sometimes feels like the passing of the torch. It makes me want to learn how to restore muscle cars and hunt with a bow and arrow.Max the BeardoDapper Days (and proof point on why beards are catnip to us ladies - meow...)

Frosted tips. Oversized t-shirts. Roller blades. So hot. The '90s gave us some real sizzling hot babes, some of whom have stood the test of time. They might not have their boyish looks anymore, but now they\u2019re MEN, with beards, fine lines, and hints of gray in their hair (as opposed to blonde). But fifteen years after the '90s ended, these hear-throbs still got it. Here are ten of the hottest.1) Jared Leto(source)(source)Jordan Catalano is still one of the dreamiest boys at school. Nobody told his face that he\u2019s supposed to be 43.2) Erik von Detten(source)(source)I loved Erik von Detten in\u00a0Brink. Who knew roller blading could be so hot? It\u2019s past time for a Kickstarter to raise money for\u00a0Brink 2.\u00a03) Devon Sawa(source)(source)Devon Sawa was the ideal quirky cute floppy-haired '90s teen dream, and now he has moved on from\u00a0Idle Hands\u00a0and\u00a0Final Destination\u00a0to looking hot on\u00a0Nikita. I actually found out that he was on\u00a0Nikita\u00a0because a Smosh reader tweeted it at me. Sometimes y\u2019all really are doing god\u2019s work.4) Nick Carter(source)(source)In the battle between the Backstreet Boys and N*Sync, I always came down on the Backstreet side because Nick was hotter than JT. And even though JT\u2019s the one who achieved major solo success, Nick is still pretty cute and I hope that\u2019s a good consolation prize.5) Andrew Keegan(source)(source)Andrew Keegan is famous for playing the douche in\u00a010 Things I Hate About You, and now he\u2019s the leader of his own religion! That\u2019s true.6) Skeet Ulrich(source)(source)Skeet Ulrich shot to fame in\u00a0Scream\u00a0and\u00a0The Craft\u00a0as the cute guy who always looked inexplicably tired. He\u2019s still acting and now plays the handsome man who always look inexplicably tired.7) Jason Priestley(source)(source)Jason Priestley was almost impossibly pretty as a teenager. Now he\u2019s 46 and he has some crinkles around his eyes, some salt in his pepper, but regardless of the march of time, Brandon Walsh can still get it.8) Brian Austin Green(source)(source)Brian Austin Green, or BAG for short, was the teen idol for girls who secretly found Vanilla Ice attractive. But BAG grew up, did a bunch of pushups, married Megan Fox, and turned out to be totally hot in a totally un-embarrassing way.\u00a09) Freddie Prinze, Jr.(source)(source)Zack Siler stole our hearts in\u00a0She\u2019s All That, and then married Sarah Michelle Gellar and somehow decided that he loved her more than the rest of us. Freddie Prinze Jr. has since largely retreated from acting to focus on his family, but I saw him at Whole Foods a couple years ago, and he looked exactly the same except now he has grayish hair.10) Ryan Phillippe(source)(source)Ryan Phillippe was impossibly pretty in\u00a0I Know What You Did last Summer\u00a0and\u00a0Cruel Intentions. If you haven\u2019t seen\u00a0Cruel Intentions, make it your number one life priority right now. R. Phil is still acting but not still aging. This dude is 40, y\u2019all. That\u2019s insane.\u00a0What do you think? Find yourself lusting after any 40 year old men? I\u2019ve been doing it for years, it\u2019s normal.

It\u2019s a look that makes a man look like a zany inventor\u2014or a meme. 1880/90: The Full Bush 3/13 Getty Images 1880/90: The Full Bush Thanks to history's two hairiest presidents\u2014Rutherford Hayes and, briefly, James Garfield\u2014the last part of the century was a beard-growin' free-for-all. In this bushy period, long before the invention of the electric clipper, facial hair was allowed to be free. There is a strong possibility that your facial hair right now is nostalgic for this era. 1900/10: The Handlebar Mustache 4/13 Getty Images 1900/10: The Handlebar Mustache Contrary to hipster belief, the handlebar mustache was invented at the turn of the century\u2014not in an artist\u2019s Williamsburg garage circa 2009. President Taft brought the art of tip-twirling to the White House, where it left such an impression that another mustache hasn\u2019t inhabited the Oval Office since. 1920: The Distinguished Uncle 5/13 Getty Images 1920: The Distinguished Uncle While the young gents of the roaring \u201820s were ducking in and out of speakeasies, full beards made a comeback on a distinguished set of older gents. Think snowy-haired industrialists and railroad tycoons. Or Harrison Ford in one of his don\u2019t-be-fooled-by-the-gray-I-can-still-knock-you-out phases. 1930: Dainty Mustaches 6/13 Getty Images 1930: Dainty Mustaches First there was the Charlie Chaplin mustache\u2014also known as the \u201ctoothbrush mustache\u201d because it was about the size and shape of a toothbrush. Let\u2019s not talk about that one. It went out of fashion hard. Then came the \u201cpencil mustache,\u201d popularized by Clark Gable. This thin strip across the upper lip stays out of the way of the nose, and looks down upon heavier mustaches. 1940/50: Birth of the Goatee 7/13 Getty Images 1940/50: Birth of the Goatee Dizzy Gillespie brought in the soul patch, and the Beatnik movement birthed the goatee. The early look was neat and thin\u2014think of it as a natural outgrowth of the pencil mustache. An outgrowth that could be thoughtfully stroked in a smoky jazz club. 1960: The Goatee Grows Up 8/13 Getty Images 1960: The Goatee Grows Up Counter culture. Coffee houses. Che Guevara. It was time to let those goatees be free. Mustaches reconnected with noses. Soul patches attained the length that would eventually qualify them as \u201cflavor savors.\u201d Men let their facial hair be, well, hairy, with the concept of \u201cscruff\u201d joining the revolution. 1970: The Horseshoe Mustache 9/13 Getty Images 1970: The Horseshoe Mustache The \u201870s were a huge decade for hair in general. Guys quit going to the barber. The Bee Gees were a thing. The explosion of facial hair provided the perfect canvas for the decade\u2019s greatest invention: the horseshoe mustache. It will forever belong to Hulk Hogan, but it\u2019s available to any guy who wants to throw on a trucker hat and crush a beer in his fist. 1980: The Chevron 10/13 Getty Images 1980: The Chevron The \u201880s were a mustache cage match, and there was one winner: Tom Selleck. This paragon of manhood introduced the world to his full, luxurious, lip ornament on \u201cMagnum PI.\u201d We shudder to think of him without it. Stay strong, Tom. For you, every month is Movember. 1990: Alt Goatees 11/13 Getty Images 1990: Alt Goatees Remember those well-behaved midcentury goatees? The \u201890s made the goatee-soul-patch combo the new facial hair of alt rock. It became bold and thick. We\u2019re looking at you, Fred Durst, Kid Rock, Rob Zombie\u2014the list goes on. With the right attitude, any guy can still embrace this \u201890s vibe. 2000: Five o\u2019 Clock Shadow Plus 12/13 Getty Images 2000: Five o\u2019 Clock Shadow Plus The early aughts were all about almost growing a beard. Think Keanu Reeves and Colin Farrell with soft patches of scruff dappling their jaw lines. It was a soft look that said, \u201cNever mind my beard, girl, get lost in my eyes.\u201d It was self-assured but not hyper-masculine. Which meant another big beard\u00a0blast was imminent. 2010: Lumbersexuals 13/13 Getty Images 2010: Lumbersexuals Grow \u2018em long. Grow \u2018em strong. The \u201ctwenty-teens\u201d have been defined by the biggest beard volumes in over a century. Wild and scraggly, billowing, and unkempt, these are the beards of guys who just rode in from the frontier, and are now enjoying a chai latte at their boutique design firm. But, hey, when you can impress people with the sheer number of days it\u2019s been since you last shaved, why not keep it up another week? Or another decade.

The history of the goatee goes back to ancient Roman and ancient Greek times where Gods were depicted with goatee styled facial hair. It has also gained popularity around the 90s through to present times, with men being able to maintain and get creative with their beards with the advancements of beard trimming technology. Maintaining a goatee can be difficult, especially if you don\u2019t have the right tools and processes. For years men have only had disposable razors and sub-standard electric razors to tame the beast, and I still see guys struggling today. You only have to look on places like Quora or male grooming forums and groups on Facebook to see them asking for advice on the correct way to shape a goatee or what trimmers to use. It\u2019s daunting when you have spent all that time and effort growing a goatee for you then to mess it up when you go to shape or trim it. Trimming a goatee isn\u2019t the hardest thing to do in the world. Let\u2019s face it, it\u2019s not calculus or quantum physics, however there are a few rules to go by in order to shape and keep a goatee in good order. So here\u2019s my guide on everything you need to know about goatees, which will cover shaping goatees, styling goatees and trimming them so they look neat, smart and well kept. I will go through the important stages a man should take to shape his goatee in the best way possible for the best outcome possible. Follow my lead and you will get the perfect goatee. All that I am about to reveal is a product of my Father teaching me how he kept his beard and also through my trials and tribulations as a bearded man for much of my adult life. Tools That You Will Need To Shape Your Goatee It\u2019s quite a simple little set of tools you will need to shape and maintain your goatee. 1. First up you will need a really good beard trimmer to be able to shape your goatee. To get that really well kept look, an electric beard trimmer is a must. I\u2019ve listed the best 3 beard trimmers\u00a0here for you take a look. 2. Secondly, a nice sharp pair of scissors and a comb. 3. Thirdly, a good quality electric razor or disposable razor, whatever you prefer to shave with. Check out the best electric razors for 2017 here! Lastly you might want to use some product on your beard like wax or a good quality beard oil. I\u2019m not one for using any product at all, but I know some guys like to condition their beard as it makes it feel good and healthy looking. It\u2019s up to you. So let\u2019s get started with my goatee grooming guide! Step # 1 \u2013 The Growing I\u2019m going to state the obvious here but to get the best looking goatee beard you need to have a fair bit of growth. Go without shaving for a week or two to really get a nice full and thick beard to work with. This will give you more than enough to work with when you do actually start to shape your goatee. It doesn\u2019t take long to achieve this style of facial hair compared to other beards. A truly epic goatee will take no more than 3 weeks to achieve. Step # 2 \u2013 Think about the shape of your goatee When you\u2019ve grown enough beard to be in a position to shape a goatee, then now is the time to get thinking about how it\u2019s going to look. Goatees do come in different shapes and sizes. You might like the idea of a narrow goatee or a more rounded style to suit your facial bone structure. One tip I can offer when it comes to planning your goatee is to draw lines on your face with a market pen where you might want to shape to and see what that looks like. Just remember to use a washable marker and not a permanent one! Here are some goatee styles to get inspiration from and to see what style would suit your face. A goatee beard can do wonders for you if you have a small round face, because it can make your face seem longer. If you have a long face long then you might want to go for a half goatee where you have a stubble moustache and a small beard on the tip of the chin. A small chin-only goatee with a light moustache is a good style as it\u2019s pretty much transferrable to any face shape, even more so if you have a small thin face. Moving slightly away from the traditional goatee, you can have a chin strip which is a distant cousin to the goatee \ud83d\ude09 This suits square and triangular faces. You need to be able to figure out how far you want your goatee to be in relation to your chin, whether you want to grow it down towards your neck or to have it stop at the edge of your chin. From my experience of having once had a goatee beard, I have found that a three finger width gap between your adams apple and the bottom of your goatee is a good measurement to work to. So to do this just put your hand under your chin so that your three fingers are going from right to left. The fit two or three finger widths between your adams apple and your chin and go with the point to trim to. This isn\u2019t always good for everyone, so please do what you feel is right for your face. Your next decision is the length of your goatee from you chin. Do you keep it nice and short / tight to your face or have a bit of length coming down. This decision can be made over time as it takes longer to grow the length in a beard. Step 3 \u2013 Comb the beard before trimming To do the first shape on your soon to be goatee, you need to make sure that your beard is combed through. Get a fine-toothed comb or beard brush and\u00a0brush it down through the beard. You don\u2019t want any curled hair as this could mean you take a chunk of beard out and be left with patches. By combing through you will free up tangles as well. Next you will want to take your beard trimmer and set it to the desired length you want your beard, so you get the beard nice and even in length. Best Electric Beard Trimmers For Shaping Goatees Electric beard trimmers are a great convenience for the shaping and upkeep of goatee beards. We have identified the best 3 electric beard trimmers for shaping and up-keeping a goatee beard and the best thing is that they don\u2019t cost the earth. Beard trimmers are an essential bit of kit when it comes to maintaining a goatee. They will get long and unkept looking if you don\u2019t trim it now and again, and the easiest way to do this is by having an adjustable trimmer that will regulate the length of your goatee beard. Philips Series 9100 Laser Guided Beard Trimmer I use this trimmer all the time. I love it as it has a laser to guide you when you are shaping your goatee. It\u2019s ideal for those who have an eye for exceptional facial hair detail and for those who are complete newbies when it comes to beard growing and shaping. The laser just makes everything 10x easier! This amazing bit of beard trimming kid is one of the most advanced ways to keep your goatee in order and easiest too. Achieving perfectly straight lines is a breeze and if you want to try out more complex styles like linking up the side burns with your goatee then this is the trimmer for you. It features 17 LED displayed lengths from 0.4mm to 7mm, which means that you can not only go close shave, but also trim the longer bearded areas of you face. The Philips 9100 has steel blades which are really durable and will last you years. It\u2019s totally waterproof, so you can use it in the shower if you want and it\u2019s perfect for on the go. Another great feature about the Phillips 9100 is the dual sided trimmer to get in and shave those hard to reach areas like under the nose or under the chin. This is my number one choice of beard trimmers for goatee beards. BaByliss for Men Super Stubble Like the Phillips 9100, the BaByliss super stubble is one of the best ways to maintain your goatee beard. The Babyliss Super Stubble is designed for guys who want total control of their goatee beard, giving them the tools to shape and trim. There\u2019s 24 precise settings on Babyliss super stubble, so you can go short or long, as it uses a motorised length control. Get the exact length and look you want at a touch of a button. It has a floating head feature which allows the razor to follow the contours of your face. Get close in to the defined line of your goatee with the electro-chemically sharpened blades for a super accurate cut. Braun cruZer 6 Face Another reliable and versatile shaver for the goatee beard wearer. Braun\u2019s cruZer 6 Face is great value for money for a well built and functional beard trimmer. With this trimmer you can do all three of trimming, styling and shaving, which makes the Braun a jack of all trades and master of all!! You get 4 trimming lengths on this trimmer which is ideal for maintaining a goatee. Add this to the SmartFoil technology and the Braun can capture hairs growing in different directions. It\u2019s fully waterproof so you can use it in the shower. The cruZer 6 also has a twistable, two sided trimmer which makes trimming and finishing off a goatee style easy as pie! Step 4 \u2013 The Outline This is the most important stage of achieving the perfect goatee. Outlining the shape is vital and as a guide you should use the angle of your moustache, as this will tell you how wide your goatee will be on your chin. As I mentioned earlier, you could use a washable marker to outline the design and create a cutting guide. Step 5 \u2013 The Cutting Once you have the outline sorted and you\u2019re happy with what you see, you can then start the exciting part of the process\u2026the shaving!! Three weeks of growth, itching and wanting to have a shave is about to come to an end! You will finally have a badass goatee! What you will need to do next is to cut to the outline of the goatee. Define this by using a very sharp razor or a trimmer that doesn\u2019t have a guard. I find the best way to define the goatee is to use the sharpest razor possible. I use a Gillette Fusion for this, as it gives that sharp definition you need for a goatee. Shave right up against the sides of the hair. Make sure your beard has been wet with nice warm water as this makes shaving it easier. What you will get is an incredibly well-defined line at the sides and underneath. I like to start from my neck by making small shaving strokes against the growth direction of your beard at all times. Shave up to two to three figure widths from the adams apple, so you get a basic idea of how your goatee will take shape. This way you\u2019re not cutting too far in to the goatee as its always easier to take more off, if need be once you have a look and assess where you are at. Step 6 \u2013 Making Amends To The Shape So you have cut to your outline using either a razor or an un-guarded trimmer, and you now have a goatee shape. Now what you want to do is take a look at what you have and see if you need to make any more amends to the shape. You may feel that you want to bring up the goatee under your chin or make the sides thinner. If that\u2019s the case then just make another outline on the areas you want to trim and repeat the process. Step 7 \u2013 Shaving the rest of your beard. When you grow a goatee you really need to just grow a full beard to start with, as this makes it easier to shape. Once you have shaped the goatee, you will need to shave the rest of the face that will remain clean shaven. Bath the face in warm water to make the beard nice and soft. Massage in some shaving foam to prepare my skin for shaving. I use clear shaving gel, so that I can see the defined edges of my goatee, so I can get it nice and close to my hair line. To get a close shave to the definition line of your goatee, always shave away from the goatee line. Because the skin is soft and slippery because of the gel or shaving foam, the razor can easily cut more than what you would have wanted to. The last thing you want is to take a chunk of hair out of your newly defined goatee! You\u2019d have to start again! Put the razor on the defined line of your goatee and shave away from it. This applies to guys who are using an electric razor as well. Step # 8 \u2013 Step Away And\u00a0Take A Look After every major cut, just step back and take a look at your efforts. Check it out from a distance and see what it looks like. Make sure you have a close up look as well, as you can miss out things when you are concentrating hard on the outline of the goatee. Step 9 \u2013 The Clean Up Once you have completed all of the steps listed above, it\u2019s time to clean up and reveal your awesome new goatee! Wash you face in some clean warm water to wash away all the loose hair and soap from your beard and face. You can then apply different products to enhance the beard and moisturize the beard, but this depends on each person\u2019s own personal preference. Shaving and goatee trimming can be very messy, so make sure you clean the bathroom after or you will be in deep trouble with the woman / women in your life! Final Thoughts At the end of the day, how you decide to shape your goatee is completely up to you as its your goatee and you need to feel comfortable with it. Make it unique to you and have it fit your own sense of style, but ultimately keep it well and make sure you trim every two weeks so it looks nice and tight.

I can't grow one cos I get f\u00facking flakes and my skin gets irritated on my chin. Inb4Ishouldletitgrowout. It doesn't work. Just gets more white flakes so I have to keep it completely shaven. My face is too round anyway and after 3 or 4 days I look crap. Being completely shaven makes me look younger and more chiseled. I think a long beard like most of you guys have only looks good with long hair anyway. \"Sig line can't be a novel\" - Some mod 07-10-2014, 06:41 AM #2424 Kaikara View Profile View Forum Posts Premium Member Join Date: Jun 2008 Location: Missouri, United States Posts: 2,711 Rep Power: 5836 Originally Posted by hiimnotcool I just buzzed my hair for summer since its hot.

OK thanks, I haven't trimmed it yet. Currently looks very similar to this in length and density (sorry about the homo pic)... I only want short beard, can't anything too heavy due to work. So I'm opting for a similar length to this guy Any advice on beard trimmer length for that?

I hit the 1-year mark: Goal was to go 1 year, and decided to trim it up since it's in the mid 90s now here and I have no AC in my house... fuking hot as balls. Took my electric razor and used the clipper attachment and just used the longest setting (9). Then hit the sides with a 3 to make it a bit shorter to blend in better: before trimming it: Felt pretty bad the first day, kinda like I had lost a kid lol.

It was also a great time for the goatee, with sluggers like Mark McGwire, Jeff Bagwell, Ken Caminiti and Larry Walker regularly sporting them. This carried into the early 2000s with guys like Albert Pujols, but it seems to be lost on most of today\u2019s best hitters. That\u2019s a damn shame, too, because obviously they would look way more badass, as you can clearly see below.Today\u2019s MLB Sluggers With \u201990s Style GoateesMike TroutGiancarlo StantonMark TeixeiraPaul GoldschmidtNelson CruzTodd FrazierChris DavisKris BryantTorii HunterBryce HarperMore from the MLB: Major League Baseball\u2019s Biggest Stars Without Their Shirts On SHARE TWEET ContactAdvertiser InfoPrivacy PolicyTerms & ConditionsAdChoicesCraveOnline.com is a property of CraveOnline Media, LLC, an Evolve Media, LLC company. \u00a9 2017 All Rights Reserved.

If you are planning on getting your 90\u2019s on hair-wise, that is, this is the place for you. We start with the ubiquitous Rachel do which you couldn\u2019t get away from (and, really, who would want to \u2013 it was so damn cute). But, we don\u2019t stop there.\u00a0 We explore the ins and outs of 90s facial hair fashions and more.\u00a0 Read on. Let us know what kind of hair you had in the 90s (and better yet, send pics!) by posting it on our \t\t\t90s 411 Facebook page. The burning questions need answers \u2013 like, who had better hair: George Clooney or Dawson? The Rachel | 90\u2019s Hairstyles for Women (non-Rachel) | 90\u2019s Hairstyles for Men | The Caesar | 90s Facial Hair Continue Reading Below The Rachel \"So I want it kind of rough and ready but like really shiny and smooth and kind of chin length but shoulder lengthy and like straight but a bit curly and a sort of golden brown but a bit blonde. Wait a minute let me get my People Magazine out!\" That was the conversation held in thousands of hair salons in the mid-90s as women everywhere tried to describe the \"Rachel Cut\" named after and inspired by the character played by Jennifer Aniston in the sitcom Friends which was then at the peak of its popularity. This definitive 90\u2019s hairstyle was a shoulder-length, sleek and layered style with a grown out fringe and highlights mainly around the face. It was the most popular hair fashion fad of the 90\u2019s and the envy of all women. It also inspired many a \"just got out of bed\" hair product, for example one of the originals Tigi Bed Head. > back to top 90s Hairstyles for Women (non-Rachel) I, having dark brown hair which refuses to get anywhere closer to blonde than a hideous bleached Cheshire Cat orange, never really had the full benefit of the Rachel Do or the absolute flood of beach blonde hair that was in fashion but 90\u2019s fashion had a hairstyle for everyone and I went through a few. I started with the short Demi Moore in Ghost do, moved on to the short, choppy Meg Ryan style then swiftly onto the Winona Ryder in Mermaids bob and the heavy Terri Hatcher Louis and Clark shiny bob before finally smoothing and thinning out for a Posh Spice bob in the late 90\u2019s. I unfortunately never had hair long enough for the super straight straggled Grunge look or the wavy Julia Roberts look and wasn\u2019t going to touch the Demi Moore GI Jane skinhead look with a very long stick. For an overview in 1990\u2019s hairstyles, we recommend a reviewing of uber-popular 90\u2019s TV shows such as Beverly Hills 90210 and Melrose Place. > back to top 90\u2019s Hairstyles for Men Boys had their own trends to follow. For the daring fashion crowd there were hair styles with zig zags and Nike ticks shaved into them and inspired by Hip Hop artists and big bleached hair inspired, not by the previous decade\u2019s Wham but by the \"pretty fly for a white guy\" MC Hammer wannabe Vanilla Ice. Will the real Slim Shady please stand up? For the everyday boy on the street the look was floppy and dreamy like Dawson of Dawson\u2019s Creek, Joey of Friends, Edward Furlong pre voice breaking in Terminator 2 and Keanu Reeves of\u2026. well practically every 90s movie going! This was the look for anyone wanting to attract a girlfriend rather than make a nineties fashion statement. The kind of hair that made you just ache to lean over and gently move it out of their adorable eyes just before they told you they loved you, gave you a slow sloppy kiss and recited a bit of poetry! > back to top The Caesar Finally, let us not forget the ubiquitous, ultra-short Caesar style which looked just gorgeous on the more mature man such as George Clooney in ER and Russell Crowe in Gladiator but unfortunately made anyone under the age of thirty look like they were going to steal your purse and mug your neighbors. > back to top 90s Facial Hair Since it involved hair and was on the head generally, we are including an analysis of men\u2019s facial hair trends in the 1990\u2019s as well. The Goatee One look for men which was executed with style by some and in the worst way possible by others was the goatee. This devilish style swept through the male chin world of the 1990s and, despite making people look a little like the devil, can still be seen on many chins today. The goatee was equally at home on the band member of a Grunge band (90\u2019s icon Kurt Cobain) as it was on the lead singer of a Jazz Funk band (remember Jamiroquai and the Godzilla music video?). It was named the goatee because of it\u2019s similarity to a Billy goat beard and was the perfect way to wear a beard without looking like your dad. For successful attempts at goatees then check out 1990\u2019s Brad Pitt or Johnny Depp. Or, as I mentioned previously \u2013 the Devil. For less coveted versions think Colonel Sanders, Lenin or my high school friend Dan who, after his failed attempt at growing a goatee, was never again called \"Dan\" in his high school career. Due to the unfortunate coarse curly hair which made up his goatee he was forever more called \"Pubic Hair Chin!\" Long Side Burns Another popular hair trend for men in the 90\u2019s was the long, thick sideburn. Perhaps this burn lengthening was wrapped up in the 70s revival in the fashion world. Whatever the impetus, burns got longer and thicker and were (I\u2019ll admit it) a weakness of mine. Think Chris Isaak in the very sexy \tWicked Game era or Jason Priestly of 90210. In case you are interested, Dan (my goatee-growing friend from high school) eventually got rid of the goatee. But, I haven\u2019t learned my lesson yet and still have a twice yearly disastrous attempt at going classic 90\u2019s \tBaywatch blonde.

To honor the memory of the inventive creator, we\u2019re traveling through his most memorable characters and iconic fashions.Davy Jones To get a true sense of Bowie\u2019s incredible transformations, it\u2019s worth going back to the very beginning, to the time before he was David Bowie. The creator was born Davy Jones, the son of a waitress and a charity promotions officer with a talent for music and performance. Looking at the photo above, he looks like another kid in the U.K. during the mid-\u201960s. The musician began going by David Bowie in 1967, inspired by 19th-century American frontiersman and knife enthusiast Jim Bowie, though it would still be several years before Bowie would really break out with his first bold persona.Ziggy Stardust Bowie\u2019s first and probably most iconic alter-ego is Ziggy Stardust, the rockstar alien messenger first brought to the world on Bowie\u2019s 1972 album\u00a0The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. Clad in colorful body suits with popping red hair and bold make-up, Ziggy\u2019s androgynous style invited outcasts and individuals of all types into the world of rock \u2018n roll, and in doing so laid the groundwork for the glam rock style that would become popular in the following years. But more importantly, Ziggy catapulted Bowie into stardom, bringing a cult-like fanbase to the performer.Aladdin Sane Aladdin Sane was Bowie\u2019s continuation of the Ziggy Stardust character, and while stylistically similar, had one major difference \u2014 a massive lightning bolt painted across his face. The character made his debut on Bowie\u2019s 1973 album\u00a0Aladdin Sane, and was inspired by Bowie\u2019s 1972 U.S. tour. As Bowie put it, the Aladdin Sane is essentially \u201cZiggy goes to America,\u201d bringing an edge to Bowie\u2019s original bombastic character. After all, Aladdin Sane is a pun on \u201cA Lad Insane,\u201d displaying Bowie\u2019s penchant for playing with multiple personalities through both music and fashion.The Thin White Duke For his final major persona, David Bowie adopted a massive stylistic shift. Dubbed The Thin White Duke, the character\u2019s primarily associated with 1976\u2019s Station to Station, conceived\u00a0at the height of Bowie\u2019s own cocaine use. The Duke\u2019s style is somewhat mundane yet effortlessly classy, characterized by his tailored black pants, white dress shirt and waistcoat. However, that upper-class veneer hides a dark side, with the Duke\u2019s ice-cold mentality and lack of empathy on full display in Bowie\u2019s lyrics.\u201990s Experimentation After retiring The Thin White Duke, David Bowie largely abandoned the characters he clung to during the \u201970s and \u201980s. That said, he still shifted his personal style to better suit his music. During the \u201990s, Bowie\u2019s music took a turn for the experimental, introducing an industrial rock style to the creator\u2019s repertoire that was accompanied by a radical shift in fashion. The singer adopted a goatee, spiked hair and frosted tips more in line with the industrial rock crowd than his glamourous looks from earlier in his career.The Elder Statesman In the later period of his life, Bowie\u2019s style evolved to a dignified, classic look. The artist, a much-respected figure worldwide, wasn\u2019t concerned with creating wild new looks but instead focused more on crafting meaningful music. While Bowie would still adopt characters and costumes for music videos, he\u2019d stick with more traditional garb for his performances and appearances, letting his art do the talking.What\u2019s your favorite David Bowie look?

I have most answers to pretty much any question that's going to be asked. ask Dave a question and he'll answersend questions to asknursedave@gmail.com Wednesday, March 28, 2012 Facial Hair Guidelines Nurse Dave, Since i met you you've always had some kind of assortment of facial hair. Myself being a man that keeps a goatee im interested if there are facial hair standards/guidelines/do's and donts that you try to live by. Nathan, Mesa, AZ First thing to realize is that there are no don'ts for facial hair. Only do's. The question is what do you want your facial hair to say and then groom it to make that statement. The Homeless Beard The homeless beard soared to popularity in a few years ago. It makes a powerful statement, \"Hey I choose to look this way. Am I homeless or not? I'm not sure maybe you should spend a few minutes to get to know me. Who knows what I might have to offer.\" The homeless beard works well for outdoor enthusiasts, hollywood actors trying to let loose and people with real problems. The Long Goatee There was a resurrgence of for goatees in the mid 90's and nobody did the long goatee as well as Alexi Lalas (US soccer player dude). I think the statement he was making was, \"Hey look at my goatee, you think I could braid this thing?\" This kind of facial hair works well for former gang members, professional cleaners and members of metal bands. The Tasteful Mustache I'm not sure this look could ever go out of style. The mustache exudes a natural sexuality and classiness that other facial hair can't compete with. A mustache says, \"Hey you want to take me seriously, I mean really seriously.\" This look works well for album covers, weddings and coaching. The Evil Goatee Frequently goatees are used to denote that a character has turned to either evil or steroids. The evil goatee can be used for good but it is difficult to harness the power for good (you'll probably need this to do it). The evil goatee says, \"I'm the evil twin of the guy you normally see when he doesn't have a goatee. Can I borrow your car?\" This look works well for job interviews at banks, hitting 60 or more homeruns and being a waiter at Texas Roadhouse. Be careful with this look. Side Burns Now you can go a number different directions with sideburns but I think we can all agree that the only real direction to go is as pictured above. Sideburns are for awesomely hot dudes from the 90's and make the statement, \"Yeah I'll hang with you but I'm low on cash. Could you spot me a few?\" But honestly I can't grow real sideburns and have always felt the loss after watching all those episodes of 90210. Sideburns work well for guys that are very very cool, guys that are way into the 1950s or 1990s, and Wolverine. The Scruffy Beard This is the look I try to go for but really can't achieve. It says, \"Hey I'm relaxed, good looking, informed about interesting subjects or at least I want you to think those things about me.\" This works well for indie rock musicians, fans of indie rock music, nurses, good looking men, not good looking men and therapists. The Chinstrap I don't know what to say about this one other than just that I'm grateful that we have facial hair. Everyone can find the look for them. All it takes is a razor and so kind of clippers or facial hair grooming kit. The list of facial hair looks goes on and on. The Bad Mustache,The Chin Only Goatee,The handlebar, The Fu Manchu, The super groomed. Really Nathan you just have to decide what you need to say and say it.

It started with the sideburns at 16 (14 years ago) and it was only in the last 6 months I could grow a mustache.I think every man should bow down to the power of Frank Zappa's mustache.ReplyDeleteDaveApril 3, 2012 at 10:29 AMi still can't really grow facial hairReplyDeleteAdd commentLoad more...

Moustache I started growing a moustache in October.\u00a0 Aside from an unfortunate phase in the 90s when I experimented with a goatee, I've never ventured into the world of facial hair.\u00a0 The moustache has been unexpectedly rewarding.\u00a0 I'm used to very long, drawn-out processes like sculpture, where short-term gratification does not exist.\u00a0 Even pottery requires two firings and glazing decisions (ie. weeks) before a finished object appears. I found myself delighted by the various phases of the moustache in relatively little time.\u00a0 Its appearance changed nearly every day.\u00a0 There was the trim cop-moustache phase for a week.\u00a0 The old Hollywood phase and then lately the handlebar.\u00a0 The handlebar to me was always the destination so now it's a matter of focusing on the variations of the end curls.\u00a0 Throughout the month of November multiple people asked if I grew the moustache for Movember (the campaign to raise awareness for prostate and testicular cancer).\u00a0 I didn't know about Movember at first, but I was pleased that my moustache development coincided with it. Classic men's grooming has always fascinated me, not least because of of my interest in smells.\u00a0 My mother always kept a can of Pinaud's talcum on her hairdressing station.\u00a0 When I lived in London I would regularly lurk around Jermyn Street inspecting combs and badger shave brushes while sniffing Bay Rum at Geo F Trumper. Of course I was excited to experiment with moustache waxes as my upper lip required grooming.\u00a0 I started with Pinaud Clubman wax because it's the easiest to find, is the least expensive and comes with a moustache brush/comb.\u00a0 The results were disappointing.\u00a0 The hold was unreliable (although, admittedly there was not much moustache to hold at the time). The white flakes of dried wax that resembled dandruff led to my decision to hold off on the Clubman.\u00a0 Shame, particularly because the scent is excellent, like Earl Gray Tea. I started using Ungarische Bartwichse from Marke Golddachs.\u00a0 It's apparently the wax Salvador Dali used to create his impossible hirsute surrealism. The scent is pleasant, a peppery beeswax with a vanilla creaminess, reminding me of a fragrance I wear, Poivre 23 by Le Labo.\u00a0 The substance itself is less stiff than the Clubman allowing easier application and molding. I recently acquired a tin of the Firehouse Moustache Wax.\u00a0 Its stiffness allows an excellent hold and I found that it's best used on the twirly bits at the end.\u00a0 The scent is a very subtle beeswax.\u00a0 It's, perhaps the perfect moustache wax for my needs.

One of these was the beginning of Pauline Hanson. Comedian Rebecca Shaw looks at some other terrible things from the 90's she'd prefer to see return instead. By Rebecca Shaw 5 Jul 2016 - 2:30 PM\u00a0 UPDATED\u00a05\u00a0Jul\u00a02016\u00a0-\u00a03:44\u00a0PM Tweet I was 15 years old when I first heard about Pauline Hanson. It was 1997, and I was reveling in the midst of peak-90s culture. Hanson (the good kind) had released MMMBop, the Spice Girls were crushing it, and my friends and I were all on our third watch of Titanic at the cinema. They were there for Leo, and i was pretending to be there for Leo while secretly coveting Kate Winslet. Enter: Pauline Hanson. She was bringing her roadshow to my hometown of Toowoomba in regional Queensland. She prompted the first ever political action i took outside of my friends and family, and I showed up to join anti-racism protesters at her event. So i have a long history of resenting Pauline Hanson, who showed up and disturbed my beautiful and idyllic 90s. It's not that the 90s were perfect, however. There were many, many terrible trends that occurred. BUT I put it to you that all of them are better than Pauline Hanson. No matter how terrible they are, I would prefer to see any and all of them return over the return of Pauline Hanson. THE FLOATING GOATEE N''sync Internet Access Sorry Joey Fatone, third or fourth most well-known member of 90's boyband N'Sync, but I was so happy to say Bye Bye Bye to this look at the end of the 90s. This also goes for Justin Timberlake\u2019s terrible noodle-hair. However, I would prefer to have to look at this on the face of every Australian man, rather than face 90\u2019s Pauline Hanson back in power. Even you, flavour savers. I would even take seeing the flavour saver everywhere I looked. All terrible men\u2019s head and facial hair would be better than this alternative. BEANIE BABIES Possibly the weirdest trend to come out of the 90s was the rise of this line of stuffed toys that were filled with beans. They became collectors items. People would resell them on eBay with 1000% markups, they would be split in divorce settlements, there was even a murder in 1999 over an argument about them. Terrifying. Everyone had at least one aunt who kept a huge and terrifying collection of them that she would keep out on display. You weren\u2019t allowed to touch them, but their eyes would follow you around the room menacingly. You were terrified. Or maybe that was just me. In any case, I would happily accept the return of these scary little creatures over Pauline Hanson. I would hold them and stroke their weird bodies, and kiss their little hard nose, staring into their dead eyes. THE MACARENA This smash hit song accompanied by a very bad dance that even the drunkest family member could do at a wedding made the early nineties hell. If you were 11 years old, say, and just trying to concentrate on reading or thinking about your Sweet Valley High books \u2013 you couldn\u2019t. The song permeated your life, and was played everywhere you went. No, please stop. And yet, I would prefer to listen to this song daily rather than hear the ignorant words fall out of Pauline Hanson\u2019s mouth. I would even prefer to make it my ringtone, and then make some friends so that they would call me, than listen to what she has to say. CLIPPY THE ANNOYING MICROSOFT OFFICE HELPER GET LOST CLIPPY Clippy came into our lives in 1997, just around the time of Pauline Hanson. One of them was intrusive, insensitive, and I never wanted to see them: and one was Pauline Hanson. And the other one was Clippy, the terrible bug-eyed paperclip animation that would pop up for no reason every five minutes and absolutely destroy the flow you were into, doing your legal studies assignment and listening to Jewel. And yet, I would take Clippy any day of the week over Pauline Hanson holding a Senate seat. In fact, put Clippy into a Senate seat instead.

Armando Iannucci is everywhere! MORE!In News09:00 on 28th Jun 2012By Nick BryanHello, and welcome to the second News Surfing column, in which I strike an uneasy balance: making fun of the latest TV developments whilst remaining enthusiastic and ultimately open-minded about them. To be honest, this also describes my relationship with most friends and family. Anyway, another packed load of news this week, including not one but two mildly appalling photographs to look at. And since a picture is worth a thousand words, I must only have a couple more sentences left to type. ITEM! We don't often cover EastEnders and its soapy brethren, but every so often, a soap news story comes up that is so exciting, so meaningful, so downright hilarious, I have to give it a few words. Earlier in the week, Digital Spy unveiled a first look at Ian Beale's return to Albert Square as a tramp, after he managed to balls up yet another marriage. Because, I guess, he's been there since the very beginning, and what storylines are really left? Alien abduction next year? In case you missed it, here's a preview. Note the beard, which must have taken actor Adam Woodyatt forever to grow, and is probably still better than his 90s moustache. ITEM! Moving on to better TV (hard work but think I've managed it), AMC have unveiled a new trailer for the upcoming fifth season of Breaking Bad. I love this show, for reasons I've already outlined on this site, so it's exciting to see Walt and Jesse in action again, but also bittersweet because it's the last season. Except not really, because they're slicing the \"fifth\" season into two eight episode chunks separated by a year, so the second may as well be a sixth season. ANYWAY. Here is the trailer. ITEM! In last week's groundbreaking first column, I linked to the latest episode of Richard Herring's Leicester Square Theatre Podcast, and I'm going to do it again, because this week has Graham Linehan (creator of Father Ted and The IT Crowd) and Armando Iannucci OBE (creator of The Thick Of It, Veep, others), which is a pretty hot line-up. So head over here to check it out. Iannucci has gotten other play in the news this week, both for his new HBO series Veep starting on Sky Atlantic and after a junior minister's verbal dismemberment by Jeremy Paxman was observed to resemble a scene from his The Thick Of It, which is all the excuse I need to embed the relevant scene. ITEM! And staying with Mr Iannucci (of OBE fame), a press release has been issued about his long awaited Alan Partridge film and its release in August 2013, in partnership with French filmmakers StudioCanal. Yes, maybe it is a movie, but Partridge comes from TV and the release features some great quotes from the man himself, so I've worked them in: \"I\u2019m simultaneously gladdened and pleased to see a British film being co-funded by the French dudes at Studiocanal. This is without doubt the greatest Anglo-French co-operation since the Normandy landings. This time, the heroes aren\u2019t Allied servicemen \u2013 they\u2019re motion picture financiers, who are equally brave.\" \"I\u2019d also like to add that \u2018canal\u2019 \u2013 or, in English, \u2018canal\u2019 \u2013 is a transportation system close to my heart. In the late 18th century, this new method of logistics halved the price of coal in many English cities. If Studiocanal\u2019s investment can achieve even a fraction of that, I will be delighted.\" ITEM! Last, and.... very possibly least, a photo has been released from the upcoming US version of The Inbetweeners, featuring the all-new all-American incarnations of our constantly masturbating heroes. This show comes to us from MTV, and we can only hope it is as successful as their US launch of Skins. How much will they change? Does \"briefcase wanker\" translate to \"document-wallet douchebag\" over there? We can only wait and see. But for now, here it is, resembling a glimpse into a horrifying parallel universe.

Get used to it. amagazinebloguk / February 12, 2014 When the 90s became the 00s and mass-produced urban culture was taking over, I\u2019ll bet anyone\u2019s vision of the future assumed that it would be technology that shaped the way we live and dress, combining it all in a fusion of sparkling modernity. In fact, the opposite seems to have occurred. The manufacture and purchase of material goods has returned its focus to the quality of the materials from which it\u2019s made, over what gimmicks and tricks the product can perform. In clothing, natural fibres, traditional tailoring and classic cuts have overtaken that desire to look modern, bringing about the rise of the hipster, the boom of vintage and the return of the beard. Aside from the odd goatee and some designer stubble, facial hair had been strikingly absent from men\u2019s fashion for a whole generation. The thought of coiffed and manicured facial hair conjured images of Bavarian waxed moustaches, or Edwardian English gentlemen bumbling about on a croquet-lawn. But in the mass media age, when we are all encouraged to craft our own niche in what we consume, our quirks are celebrated and fashion is dictated by the consumer. The human body has become as individual as the clothing, with hairstyles, tattoos and facial hair the basis of the look, not just an addition to it. When John Lewis embraced hobo chic with their fully bearded male model Johnny Harrington early last year, the beard had well and truly arrived. From chinstraps to handlebars, from mutton chops to a full shenandoah, the beard has become part of a thoroughly twenty-first century phenomenon; \u2018old\u2019 is the new \u2018new\u2019. Grandpa jumpers, battered leather shoes, satchels and plaid, men are dressed in new versions of what could be thrift, but with their faces and heads snipped and clipped and perfectly neat, juxtaposed against patterns and rough hewn fabrics. Gone are the days of wet-look spiky hair and baby-faced boys-next-door. Even the chavs have embraced the fuzz. The beard has gone fully global. The artsy alternative scenes in cities all over the world have crept out into the mainstream; individuality is the new inviolable trend. People, their homes and the media they consume have diversified to the point of complete assimilation and oddities and peculiarities, that might have been condemned to mere freakshows before, have become the norm. The full beard is definitely one of the more peculiar male fashions to find its way back to the fore, but in a world in which masculinity is losing itself in the metrosexual grooming of the twenty-first century, what can assert your manhood more than simply growing a beard? Women can\u2019t do that, can they? No matter how it\u2019s cut, a beard will always be manly. Think about that the next time you shave. By Ben Turner for A-Magazine.

I don't know man that was kinda odd how she was throwing out those sexual innuendo out there to a married man and kept on saying how handsome he was and touching him. But maybe the rumors are true that Jay and his wife have an open relationship, I mean they been together for so long since they were teens and have no children. Who knows maybe she participates in some wild nights at the Cutler house with jay and his wife? If she dated that guy then you know she has been to the clinic on more than one occasion.

Home Tag Archives: Sheldon Cooper Television and the Autism\u00a0Spectrum 2 Comments Posted by CultureCast-Z on March 19, 2013 Editor\u2019s Note: I am a licensed counselor and have a background in mental health. I am fully qualified to diagnose mental disorders and counsel patients. Having said that, I am writing about the mental disorders of purely fictional characters for this article, not the actors who portray them. In the last three or four years of television, there have been quite a few characters that fans and critics have predicted fall somewhere on the Autism Spectrum, that controversial range of pervasive developmental disorders as described in the Diagnostic and Statistic Manual of Mental Disorders. Autism has been a lightning rod for controversy worldwide in the past decade, largely due to the expansion of the Spectrum itself as well as a totally false, possibly illegal retracted article linking the MMR vaccine to the development of Autism in toddlers. The three conditions generally considered part of the Autistic Spectrum include Autism, Asperger syndrome, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS for short). Traits of the Autism Spectrum are wide-ranging and unique to individuals, but generally include behavior such as limited desire for social interaction, repetitive behaviors and interests, and an overall lack of certain communicative skills. Michael Richards\u2019 portrayal of Kramer was iconic during Seinfeld\u2019s run in the 90s. In the glory days of 80s and 90s sitcoms, the weird or quirky character would often become the breakout star of a television show. Think Latka on Taxi, the enigmatic foreigner portrayed by legendary comedian Andy Kaufman. Other examples include the highly popular Kramer (Michael Richards) from Seinfeld, whose antics and shtick became so beloved that audiences were discouraged from applauding when he walked on set during filming. Lisa Kudrow\u2019s Phoebe from Friends would be another example of the quirky sitcom character. Latka, Kramer, and Phoebe share a lot of traits \u2013 they were often separated into their own story away from the main group, each was an audience favorite, and each were defined by their quirky character affectations, so much so that audiences began to anticipate their behavior before it even happened (which somewhat led to their downfalls as characters in later years \u2026 think about just how wacky Kramer got in those last two seasons of Seinfeld). The quirky, off-beat sitcom character still exists on television in the 2010s. Fox built an entire show (New Girl) around Zooey Deschanel, for example. Deschanel is often seen as the height of \u201cadorkable,\u201d a marketing term used primarily to ground the actress amongst her fans to seem more accessible. I don\u2019t think Deschanel\u2019s character, Jess, fits into the Autism Spectrum, however. I feel the same about Ty Burrell\u2019s Phil from Modern Family, who is the quirkiest, funniest cast member on that sitcom (and also the lead actor, despite what the Emmy\u2019s or the show itself will say). Burrell and Deschanel both share common traits with Kaufman, Richards, and Kudrow, however. All of them are gifted comic actors with great physicality. Zooey Deschanel as Jess on Fox\u2019s New Girl. In other recent sitcoms, there are a number of characters who fall into the quirky role, but these characters are, to me, a bit different than the breakouts established in the 80s and 90s shows, and even on New Girl and Modern Family. The Big Bang Theory\u2019s Sheldon, skillfully played by Emmy winner Jim Parsons, Community\u2019s Abed Nadir, also wonderfully played by Danny Pudi, and Bob\u2019s Burger\u2019s Tina Belcher (voiced by Dan Mintz), are three characters whom fans and critics have speculated fall somewhere onto the Autism Spectrum. There is also Brick Heck from ABC sitcom The Middle, but I don\u2019t watch that show regularly, so I am unable to speak about it with any sense of authority. What Sheldon, Abed, and Tina have in common is an almost painful adherence to their own individual routines, diminished or a lack of social skills, and continual problems communicating effectively with others around them. Sheldon is the fussiest of the three aforementioned characters, and also the most easily diagnosable. It is clear to me that Sheldon has Asperger\u2019s syndrome. Sheldon\u2019s interests include comic books (of which he has an encyclopedic knowledge), trains and model trains, science fiction (be it in novel, television, or film format), and his work (theoretical physics). Sheldon models himself largely after the character of Spock from Star Trek, the half-human/half-Vulcan science officer who is logical, effective, highly intelligent, and of indisputably high character. In the first few seasons of The Big Bang Theory, Sheldon served largely as a sidekick and comic foil to the other, more self-aware characters. Sheldon\u2019s traits have always been quirky and the actor has played him with a physicality that must be seen to be believed at times (a moment that pops into my head almost immediately includes Parsons jumping randomly through a child\u2019s ball pit in a Chuck E. Cheese-like establishment). But Sheldon has also been portrayed as having continual problems relating to or communicating with others, even his own best friends. For example, although Sheldon is a high respect physicist at the top of his field, he is an absolutely boring, dry, and ineffective teacher. He can\u2019t establish good communicative function with students, and is roundly mocked for even trying. Jim Parsons\u2019 portrayal of Sheldon Cooper has been praised by critics and fans. In later seasons of the show, Sheldon serves largely as the main character, where he has been just about as effective as when he was more of a side character. I haven\u2019t watched much of the current season of The Big Bang Theory (four or five episodes \u2013 I\u2019m saving it until the end of the season when I can just marathon it all), but from 2010 to 2012, Sheldon grew in a positive direction as a character, which I was happy to see. Too often sitcoms get stuck in a rut with their characters, and once-unique character behavior can often feel rote and predictable as a result. The show gave Sheldon a love interest in the form of Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler (an incredibly funny Mayim Bialik), and this has allowed Sheldon to step outside of his comfort zone continually since her introduction. While Sheldon has obviously struggled to balance the welcomed, expected routine of his personal life with the interference from an outside love interest, the show has been able to balance the two fairly effectively, essentially keeping the formula from getting stale. When Community debuted during the fall of 2009, I had no idea it would grow into the cult show that it is now. NBC\u2019s constant threats to cancel the show came off almost as a dare to an incredibly vocal but small fan base. It seemed like instead of axing the show altogether, NBC merely chose to fire the primary voice behind everything/show-runner (Dan Harmon, who is apparently notoriously difficult for studios to work with). Although the cult seems to have faded somewhat since the heady days of season two, Community is still almost feverishly worshipped online by fans and critics. Abed Nadir, the film and television-obsessed student with the general lack of normal social skills, became the adored fan-favorite break-out character. A show that was originally about a lawyer (Joel McHale\u2019s vain Jeff Winger) going back to college to get his job back turned into a show primarily consumed with deconstructing various classic pop culture tropes from film and television. Abed Nadir\u2019s character quirks include an innate desire to recreate movie and television scenes. Abed is a bit more difficult to define from a clinical perspective. His personality traits are incredibly unique, and there isn\u2019t really any other character on television like him. He has been obsessed with ABC\u2019s (now TBS\u2019s) Cougartown, a show which debuted during the same season as Community. He also became obsessed with its fictional BBC counterpart, Cougarton Abbey. He then became obsessed with science fiction show Inspector Spacetime, an obvious parody of long-running cult show Dr. Who. Abed is highly analytical, has few close friends (Troy is his closest, and first, friend), and is incredibly emotionally reserved. He often misreads social cues, much like Sheldon Cooper. He is also very Spock-like in his words and actions. I don\u2019t see Abed as having Asperger\u2019s like Sheldon, however. Abed is much tougher to diagnose. In addition to his aforementioned quirks, Abed outright seems like he lives in a fantasyland much of the time, with scenarios often playing out in his head like short films. He also makes use of what he calls the Dreamatorium, a room where he plays out fantasy scenarios and imagines an \u201cevil\u201d version of himself (who, like the evil Spock on Star Trek, has a goatee). Bob\u2019s Burgers, an animated Fox sitcom that debuted during the winter of 2011, also features a character who may or may not fall somewhere on the Autism Spectrum. Tina Belcher, the oldest of titular Bob\u2019s children, continually writes fan fiction (which she often deems to be \u201cerotic\u201d), is obsessed with certain body parts on other people (particularly butts and the touching of butts), and is nerdy and awkward to the height of hilarity. She cherishes items like her horse dolls, and indeed sees horses as magical. She often imagines herself as the friend of something that should decidedly not be able to have friends, be it an animatronic shark or her leg hair. Tina doesn\u2019t fit in with Abed and Sheldon in one particular way, however \u2013 she desires a normal teenage life, including love interests and romance in general, and she seeks out strong friendships, be it with people or the previously mentioned animatronic shark puppet. Tina\u2019s siblings often encourage her misadventures. Tina\u2019s behavior is often confusing and odd to her siblings Gene and Louise (who blame \u201cpuberty\u201d) as well as her parents, though they oftentimes do what they can to indulge her quirks. Louise, Tina\u2019s younger sister, is often the catalyst for adventures on the show, and it is usually Louise\u2019s meddling in Tina\u2019s life that makes the show so interesting (such as last week\u2019s episode where Louise tried to get Tina back together with love interest Jimmy, Jr.). Linda, wife of Bob and mother to the three Belcher children, also tends to be a catalyst for Tina\u2019s eccentric behavior, such as when she recommended her daughter read her friend-fiction aloud to her classmates during lunch to win her friends back. Bob is usually a bit more reserved in indulging Tina\u2019s behavior, often citing concern for his eldest daughter\u2019s feelings. Bob lived through awkward teenage years as well (and even had a Judd Nelson phase, complete with up-turned collar) and genuinely wants to spare his daughter any extra embarrassment she might suffer during the cruelest years of life. Of the three characters primarily discussed today, Tina of Bob\u2019s Burgers is clearly the most \u201cnormal.\u201d She is, however, not without her routines, quirks, and social misadventures. Abed is childlike some moments, near emotionless and reserved others. His wacky adventures and desire to play out his life like a movie with best friend Troy are often the highlight of Community\u2019s best episodes and moments. Sheldon Cooper has been the definition of a break-out star on The Big Bang Theory, with actor Jim Parsons winning multiple Emmy\u2019s for his performance. After observance of significant runs of these shows, I have found that each character noted here shares some form of character trait overlap. Each has had multiple episodes dedicated to exploring the routines, randomness, and interactions of these characters with the world around them. Each also seems to me to fall onto the Autism Spectrum in some way, shape, or form. I find this to be an important development in 21st century television. In the past, a character just needed to be quirky for quirky\u2019s sake (this is still the case with a few shows, such as the mentioned New Girl and Modern Family). With characters like Sheldon, Abed, and Tina, television shows now seem to have genuine reasons for characters behaving the way they do. That\u2019s more than ok with me, and TV is much better with these characters as a part of it. -Z- Share this:Share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Like this:Like Loading...

They want their soul patch back By Patrick Huguenin February 16, 2017 Getty Images Every decade has its style, whether it\u2019s top hats and monocles or parachute pants and Airwalks. Facial hair is no different. Every mutton chop, soul patch, and handlebar mustache belongs to its own special time\u2014and just because these guys belong in the modern decade doesn\u2019t mean their beards do.

In fact, Abe Lincoln was the first bearded president. With him came the \u201cchin curtain,\u201d a beard that starts just above your jaw line and goes straight down. Abe made his extra chin-y by wearing it without a mustache, and to be perfectly honest, no one has pulled it off since. 1870: Sensational Sideburns 2/13 Getty Images 1870: Sensational Sideburns The face-flanking beasts known as sideburns didn\u2019t get their name until the spectacularly scruffy Civil War general Ambrose Burnside rose to fame. His cottony white cheek fluff grew to magnificent length and connected over his lip, leaving his chin bare. It\u2019s a look that makes a man look like a zany inventor\u2014or a meme. 1880/90: The Full Bush 3/13 Getty Images 1880/90: The Full Bush Thanks to history's two hairiest presidents\u2014Rutherford Hayes and, briefly, James Garfield\u2014the last part of the century was a beard-growin' free-for-all. In this bushy period, long before the invention of the electric clipper, facial hair was allowed to be free. There is a strong possibility that your facial hair right now is nostalgic for this era. 1900/10: The Handlebar Mustache 4/13 Getty Images 1900/10: The Handlebar Mustache Contrary to hipster belief, the handlebar mustache was invented at the turn of the century\u2014not in an artist\u2019s Williamsburg garage circa 2009. President Taft brought the art of tip-twirling to the White House, where it left such an impression that another mustache hasn\u2019t inhabited the Oval Office since. 1920: The Distinguished Uncle 5/13 Getty Images 1920: The Distinguished Uncle While the young gents of the roaring \u201820s were ducking in and out of speakeasies, full beards made a comeback on a distinguished set of older gents. Think snowy-haired industrialists and railroad tycoons. Or Harrison Ford in one of his don\u2019t-be-fooled-by-the-gray-I-can-still-knock-you-out phases. 1930: Dainty Mustaches 6/13 Getty Images 1930: Dainty Mustaches First there was the Charlie Chaplin mustache\u2014also known as the \u201ctoothbrush mustache\u201d because it was about the size and shape of a toothbrush. Let\u2019s not talk about that one. It went out of fashion hard. Then came the \u201cpencil mustache,\u201d popularized by Clark Gable. This thin strip across the upper lip stays out of the way of the nose, and looks down upon heavier mustaches. 1940/50: Birth of the Goatee 7/13 Getty Images 1940/50: Birth of the Goatee Dizzy Gillespie brought in the soul patch, and the Beatnik movement birthed the goatee. The early look was neat and thin\u2014think of it as a natural outgrowth of the pencil mustache. An outgrowth that could be thoughtfully stroked in a smoky jazz club. 1960: The Goatee Grows Up 8/13 Getty Images 1960: The Goatee Grows Up Counter culture. Coffee houses. Che Guevara. It was time to let those goatees be free. Mustaches reconnected with noses. Soul patches attained the length that would eventually qualify them as \u201cflavor savors.\u201d Men let their facial hair be, well, hairy, with the concept of \u201cscruff\u201d joining the revolution. 1970: The Horseshoe Mustache 9/13 Getty Images 1970: The Horseshoe Mustache The \u201870s were a huge decade for hair in general. Guys quit going to the barber. The Bee Gees were a thing. The explosion of facial hair provided the perfect canvas for the decade\u2019s greatest invention: the horseshoe mustache. It will forever belong to Hulk Hogan, but it\u2019s available to any guy who wants to throw on a trucker hat and crush a beer in his fist. 1980: The Chevron 10/13 Getty Images 1980: The Chevron The \u201880s were a mustache cage match, and there was one winner: Tom Selleck. This paragon of manhood introduced the world to his full, luxurious, lip ornament on \u201cMagnum PI.\u201d We shudder to think of him without it. Stay strong, Tom. For you, every month is Movember. 1990: Alt Goatees 11/13 Getty Images 1990: Alt Goatees Remember those well-behaved midcentury goatees? The \u201890s made the goatee-soul-patch combo the new facial hair of alt rock. It became bold and thick. We\u2019re looking at you, Fred Durst, Kid Rock, Rob Zombie\u2014the list goes on. With the right attitude, any guy can still embrace this \u201890s vibe. 2000: Five o\u2019 Clock Shadow Plus 12/13 Getty Images 2000: Five o\u2019 Clock Shadow Plus The early aughts were all about almost growing a beard. Think Keanu Reeves and Colin Farrell with soft patches of scruff dappling their jaw lines. It was a soft look that said, \u201cNever mind my beard, girl, get lost in my eyes.\u201d It was self-assured but not hyper-masculine. Which meant another big beard\u00a0blast was imminent. 2010: Lumbersexuals 13/13 Getty Images 2010: Lumbersexuals Grow \u2018em long. Grow \u2018em strong. The \u201ctwenty-teens\u201d have been defined by the biggest beard volumes in over a century. Wild and scraggly, billowing, and unkempt, these are the beards of guys who just rode in from the frontier, and are now enjoying a chai latte at their boutique design firm. But, hey, when you can impress people with the sheer number of days it\u2019s been since you last shaved, why not keep it up another week? Or another decade.

I have most answers to pretty much any question that's going to be asked. ask Dave a question and he'll answersend questions to asknursedave@gmail.com Saturday, March 12, 2011 Lip Rash and Baseball Nurse Dave, I suffer from photosensitivity on my upper lip region. I've tried many different types of ointments and creams to treat the pinkish red skin that is sometimes accompanied with unflattering blisters but nothing seems to help my condition. I've found that the only thing that truly works has been to grow out my upper lip facial hair. This not only shields my skin from the harmful effects of the sun but also gives me a distinguished and educated look that seems to command respect wherever I go. A win, win. I love baseball. I love watching live baseball games so as to smell the sweet aroma of fresh cut grass. My budget does not allow me to attend many professional games so I find myself strolling the local parks to watch little league baseball as often as I can. I've noticed though, that I've been getting a lot of looks from the parents that are there to watch their young sons play baseball. Could my moustache be failing at hiding my pink, photosensitive upper lip and this is why I'm getting nervous stares from my fellow baseball-lovers? Regards, Noble Moustache WearerLehi, UTThe first thing we need to establish is that not everyone is in agreement on what a mustache means. We can thank Tom for all the positive things he's done for mustaches but we have to be aware that mustaches aren't always used for good in fact they can be used for evil. So somewhere in this confusion over mustaches I think lies your real problem.To understand this problem we need to go back in time. In the 70's a mustache meant that you were an extremely good looking man with lots of hair on your body. In the 80's a mustache probably meant that you played professional baseball. Mustaches took a bad turn in the 90's where they suddenly began to mean that you were a creepy man looking to prey on the innocent thats why there was also an explosion in goatees in the 90's. Men have to have facial hair and if denied a mustache they'll go to a less tasteful goatee (it even happened to Tom). The problem is we're still stuck in the 90's when it comes to mustache interpretation. Sure there are plenty of hipsters sporting ironic mustaches but no one is wearing them like they did in the 70's. I think people are looking at your face through a 90's colored lens. People see you're facial hair as evidence of some degree of inner creepiness and thus the parents at the little league games aren't noticing your lip rash but are actually noticing your lip hair.My advice to you would be to soldier on. Throughout all history nobel men have worn mustaches and we can't stop now just because a few creepy men also have worn mustaches. That'd be like refusing to wear shorts just because you heard that John Wayne Gacy Jr. loved shorts. We can't let the actions of others dictate our own fashion decisions. Just remember if someone has a problem with your mustache they don't have a problem with you, they have a problem with themselves. Either that or you could try wearing a wide brimmed hat.(Me on my wedding day) Posted by Dave at 7:04 AM Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest No comments: Post a Comment Newer Post Older Post Home Subscribe to: Post Comments (Atom) Total Pageviews Blog Archive \u25ba 2014 (1) \u25ba May (1) \u25ba 2013 (10) \u25ba September (1) \u25ba August (5) \u25ba July (1) \u25ba February (1) \u25ba January (2) \u25ba 2012 (25) \u25ba November (1) \u25ba July (2) \u25ba June (1) \u25ba May (6) \u25ba April (3) \u25ba March (7) \u25ba February (2) \u25ba January (3) \u25bc 2011 (61) \u25ba December (3) \u25ba November (3) \u25ba October (3) \u25ba September (4) \u25ba August (4) \u25ba July (7) \u25ba June (8) \u25ba May (8) \u25ba April (8) \u25bc March (12) Antibiotics Sometimes you might feel like a woman Why the ice?

When it's thick, I use this stuff on my beard and it works great. I've used other beard products, but this is my favorite so far.I usually switch between these two moustache waxes, but prefer Bounder, mainly b/c of how firm the hold is.

Truly, the vast majority of men look better (and more sexually provocative) with a little hair on their face, even if it\u2019s just a bit of strategically-cultivated stubble, and this is especially true of categorically attractive gentlemen who are also famous.

If you are planning on getting your 90\u2019s on hair-wise, that is, this is the place for you. We start with the ubiquitous Rachel do which you couldn\u2019t get away from (and, really, who would want to \u2013 it was so damn cute). But, we don\u2019t stop there.\u00a0 We explore the ins and outs of 90s facial hair fashions and more.\u00a0 Read on. Let us know what kind of hair you had in the 90s (and better yet, send pics!) by posting it on our \t\t\t90s 411 Facebook page. The burning questions need answers \u2013 like, who had better hair: George Clooney or Dawson? The Rachel | 90\u2019s Hairstyles for Women (non-Rachel) | 90\u2019s Hairstyles for Men | The Caesar | 90s Facial Hair Continue Reading Below The Rachel \"So I want it kind of rough and ready but like really shiny and smooth and kind of chin length but shoulder lengthy and like straight but a bit curly and a sort of golden brown but a bit blonde. Wait a minute let me get my People Magazine out!\" That was the conversation held in thousands of hair salons in the mid-90s as women everywhere tried to describe the \"Rachel Cut\" named after and inspired by the character played by Jennifer Aniston in the sitcom Friends which was then at the peak of its popularity. This definitive 90\u2019s hairstyle was a shoulder-length, sleek and layered style with a grown out fringe and highlights mainly around the face. It was the most popular hair fashion fad of the 90\u2019s and the envy of all women. It also inspired many a \"just got out of bed\" hair product, for example one of the originals Tigi Bed Head. > back to top 90s Hairstyles for Women (non-Rachel) I, having dark brown hair which refuses to get anywhere closer to blonde than a hideous bleached Cheshire Cat orange, never really had the full benefit of the Rachel Do or the absolute flood of beach blonde hair that was in fashion but 90\u2019s fashion had a hairstyle for everyone and I went through a few. I started with the short Demi Moore in Ghost do, moved on to the short, choppy Meg Ryan style then swiftly onto the Winona Ryder in Mermaids bob and the heavy Terri Hatcher Louis and Clark shiny bob before finally smoothing and thinning out for a Posh Spice bob in the late 90\u2019s. I unfortunately never had hair long enough for the super straight straggled Grunge look or the wavy Julia Roberts look and wasn\u2019t going to touch the Demi Moore GI Jane skinhead look with a very long stick. For an overview in 1990\u2019s hairstyles, we recommend a reviewing of uber-popular 90\u2019s TV shows such as Beverly Hills 90210 and Melrose Place. > back to top 90\u2019s Hairstyles for Men Boys had their own trends to follow. For the daring fashion crowd there were hair styles with zig zags and Nike ticks shaved into them and inspired by Hip Hop artists and big bleached hair inspired, not by the previous decade\u2019s Wham but by the \"pretty fly for a white guy\" MC Hammer wannabe Vanilla Ice. Will the real Slim Shady please stand up? For the everyday boy on the street the look was floppy and dreamy like Dawson of Dawson\u2019s Creek, Joey of Friends, Edward Furlong pre voice breaking in Terminator 2 and Keanu Reeves of\u2026. well practically every 90s movie going! This was the look for anyone wanting to attract a girlfriend rather than make a nineties fashion statement. The kind of hair that made you just ache to lean over and gently move it out of their adorable eyes just before they told you they loved you, gave you a slow sloppy kiss and recited a bit of poetry! > back to top The Caesar Finally, let us not forget the ubiquitous, ultra-short Caesar style which looked just gorgeous on the more mature man such as George Clooney in ER and Russell Crowe in Gladiator but unfortunately made anyone under the age of thirty look like they were going to steal your purse and mug your neighbors. > back to top 90s Facial Hair Since it involved hair and was on the head generally, we are including an analysis of men\u2019s facial hair trends in the 1990\u2019s as well. The Goatee One look for men which was executed with style by some and in the worst way possible by others was the goatee. This devilish style swept through the male chin world of the 1990s and, despite making people look a little like the devil, can still be seen on many chins today. The goatee was equally at home on the band member of a Grunge band (90\u2019s icon Kurt Cobain) as it was on the lead singer of a Jazz Funk band (remember Jamiroquai and the Godzilla music video?). It was named the goatee because of it\u2019s similarity to a Billy goat beard and was the perfect way to wear a beard without looking like your dad. For successful attempts at goatees then check out 1990\u2019s Brad Pitt or Johnny Depp. Or, as I mentioned previously \u2013 the Devil. For less coveted versions think Colonel Sanders, Lenin or my high school friend Dan who, after his failed attempt at growing a goatee, was never again called \"Dan\" in his high school career. Due to the unfortunate coarse curly hair which made up his goatee he was forever more called \"Pubic Hair Chin!\" Long Side Burns Another popular hair trend for men in the 90\u2019s was the long, thick sideburn. Perhaps this burn lengthening was wrapped up in the 70s revival in the fashion world. Whatever the impetus, burns got longer and thicker and were (I\u2019ll admit it) a weakness of mine. Think Chris Isaak in the very sexy \tWicked Game era or Jason Priestly of 90210. In case you are interested, Dan (my goatee-growing friend from high school) eventually got rid of the goatee. But, I haven\u2019t learned my lesson yet and still have a twice yearly disastrous attempt at going classic 90\u2019s \tBaywatch blonde.

In this bonus article, Hay reveals other challenges she and her team faced to keep four decades\u2019 worth of character looks in harmony. A big part of the department is dealing with all the facial hair that the characters have, and those who have seen the show know we\u2019re talking about a lot. Not only does the character of Jack have a big beard in one timeline and different shapes of mustaches in others, but the character of William also has a beard. \u201cI actually make all the facial hair for the show myself, which is really nice because we have a lot of control over it and how it works, and physically how it fits together,\u201d Hay says. \u201cThat makes things really easy for us.\u201d While Ventimiglia\u2019s Jack has a full beard in the pilot episode, his facial hair undergoes a lot of transition through the years, including a mustache in the \u201980s, a goatee in the \u201990s and the full beard pops up every now and again, as well. Beginning with the second episode of the show, Hay had numerous back-and-forth meetings with show creator Dan Fogelman about Ventimiglia\u2019s look, as he needed to be convinced that Hay could create a beard that audiences couldn\u2019t tell was fake. \u201cWe decided that Milo would keep his mustache\u2014we see it in 1989, the only period with his real facial hair,\u201d she says. \u201cThe beard we made for him. We shoot on an HD camera so I created something very comfortable for him to wear. It\u2019s split in three pieces at the goatee area, and the rest is hand-laid over to the top edge to blend.\u201d To complete the 1989 look, when the character is 43, Hay uses 12 small prosthetics and the stretch-and-stipple technique\u2014where the skin is stretched, the make-up goes on and dries. When the skin goes back to its normal position, it wrinkles a bit. As Ventimiglia\u2019s character moves into the 1990s, Hay really wanted to make a statement of the time, and goatees were so popular back then. \u201cThis enabled him to have some hair on his chin that we could add some gray to and help with the aging,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s hand-laid inside and just under the lip, and we add some gray to his real mustache and small sideburns to add a different look. We also add microextensions with gray into his hair to complete the whole process.\u201d Ron Cephas Jones as William Hill Ron Cephas Jones who plays William is not as old as his character appears, having just turned 60 recently, and Hay uses facial hair and some coloring in his hair to make him seem older. \u201cHe has an existing chin beard on the ball of his chin but everything else\u2014the sideburns and mustache\u2014I created to help age and shape his face,\u201d she says. When the younger William appears (circa 1980), actor Jermel Nakia is close in body type to Jones, but Hay needed to do some subtle shading on his face to narrow his nose and shape his eyes and pencil his eyebrows in so he matched his older counterpart more closely. \u201cJermel\u2019s face is much shorter in the lower portion of his face than Ron\u2019s, so what we decided to do is keep the beard, trimming and shaping it like Ron, but cheating it down onto his face a little bit lower to help create the length in his face,\u201d she says. \u201cSometimes some of these things may seem small and maybe no one would notice, but those tiny details add up to the bigger picture in making the transition more seamless.\u201d Working with the kids who play the younger versions of the Big Three is also one of Hay\u2019s favorite parts about the job. However, it does present some challenges. For example, Mackenzie Hancsicsak, who plays the 9-year-old version of Kate, is very tan; since the show started shooting in the summer, it was easy to tell she spent a lot of time by the pool. \u201cChrissy Metz is very fair, so we needed to make Mackenzie look more pale without her looking sickly,\u201d she says. \u201cPlus, we needed to do it quickly because we don\u2019t get too much time with the kids.\u201d To solve the problem, Hay went with Era Face Spray On Foundation applied to her with a brush, and then added rosy cheeks to bring some youthfulness and glow back to the skin and to create the blush look of Metz\u2019s natural coloring. From left: Lonnie Chavis as Randall, Milo Ventimiglia as Jack, Parker Bates as Kevin, Mackenzie Hancsicsak as Kate and Mandy Moore as Rebecca For the boys, the younger versions of Kevin both need to have a mole created to match that of actor Justin Hartley, and the younger versions of Kate and Kevin all have different colored eyes than their adult counterparts, so contacts are needed for each one of them. \u201cThey are all really wonderful and understand the process, plus they always bring us cookies,\u201d Hay says. \u201cEveryone here is one big, happy family and we have a great time together.\u201d For more on the make-up and hair in This Is Us, subscribe to Make-Up Artist magazine or order Issue 125 on March 14\u00a0here.

Actually it's not tantamount to walking around in leisure suit, at least where I'm from. Quite a few young guys (who aren't hipsters) have them. I do too, and I'm pretty much as anti-hipster as you can get. Then again, I don't wear a bushy 1970s mustache. I wear one similar to Gable, which I think is classier. I don't see how a mustache is \"retarded.\" If anything, goatees look retarded. Very NASCAR-ish, redneck. I think in ten years' time goatees will be looked at in the same way mullets are now. A mustache is a good midway between a beard and a goatee. It has all the rugged masculinity of a beard with all the balance of a goatee. A moustache, if worn and cropped properly, can be debonair. A beard may look regal, fierce and masculine, but a beard can never look debonair or refined. It always has a sort of barbaric look to it.

And when did they become so uncool in your opinions?Click to expand... 1991. The thing is that the mustache isn't inherently awful, it's just that.....as i've pointed out.....you need a specific look to pull it off without looking douchey or a rapist. And now, I am referring to JUST a stache. Accompanied with some sort of beard, it's usually fine. The thing is, most people who wear mustaches are older, and have had them forever. In the case of a Tom Selleck, he's kind of known for his stache. It works for him. For every picture of someone you post that looks good with one, I can find 27 who don't. Jason Giambi? Creepy. There's a reason his character \"Earl\" has one..... This time when it doesn't work even with a beard. Although, it almost works for Mel because he IS a nut. ....douchebag. WTF Michael Phelps? Very nice. This creepy for 100 reasons, but the stache doesn't help. It CAN look good.......but for the most part, it's gone the way of the mullet and the mutton chops. Ladiesman, Mar 7, 2011 #68 Pulpy Banned You picked photos of either purposefully foolish styles, or people wearing them ironically. And even a foolish style can be worn well if the wearer isn't trying to purposely look like a douchebag. John L. Sullivan, the boxer wore that upturned mustache style like the hipster you pictured wore and Sullivan was not a douchebag, but a badass. And in Mel's case, he's wearing a goatee, or van dyck. Not a mustache. Connery wouldn't look bad if it wasn't for his attire. See, there's a big difference between mustaches, and mullets and muttonchops. Mullets (1970s-1990s) and Muttonchops (1970s) were popular for only brief periods of time and were overexposed. Mustaches, on the other hand, have been worn throughout the ages, as far back as the earliest ages of mankind. They're not going to be thrown to obscurity for all time, and wearing a mustache won't get you laughed out of town unlike a mullet. And there's two things you can have with a mustache that you can't have with a goatee or full beard: variety and class. Goatees are VERY 1990s Generation X. And Generation X is the generation that's averse to mustaches. I'm guessing cause their fathers who they resent wore one at one point or something. The problem is, in the post Kurt Cobain-era, men aren't really men. Today's version of masculinity is the metrosexual, lithe, effete hipster who sits with his laptop at Starbuck's. That's a neutered version of a man.

Around here they usually will. People wear mustaches as jokes, or on a bet. It's a pretty common bet to see \"who can keep the mustache the longest\", because they tend to just look ridiculous. And there's two things you can have with a mustache that you can't have with a goatee or full beard: variety and class. Goatees are VERY 1990s Generation X.Click to expand... The goatee is still very relevant, much more so than the mustache. Again, the mustache is only really popular now because of the hipster culture. That's why there's car mustaches and those retarded finger tatoos. They're a joke.... Really, in my age range (i'm 26), the goatee is very much prevalent. Hell, some of the pictures in this thread about mustaches are goatees/beards. The mythbusters dude wears his stache as part of a goatee! And he's been posted like 100 times! If we look to Hollywood for fashion (we may or may not want to do that), the goatee or beard is the clear king in facial hair. Goatee or beard = stylish. Mustache alone = Antiquated and kinda silly And Generation X is the generation that's averse to mustaches. I'm guessing cause their fathers who they resent wore one at one point or something.

Kurt Cobain. Beard = unkempt Mustache = class Class is something we as a society have forgotten. And in my neighborhood, guys walk around with either short beards, mustaches, and sometimes goatees. They even wear sideburns here. This was one of the first images that came up when I did a google search for \"pedophile\": And 3/4ths of Black Sabbath wore mustaches. So did John Bonham. James Hetfield. Teddy Roosevelt. Clark Gable. Errol Flynn. Any one of those guys has more manliness in his fingertip than the manicured stars of today's Hollywood have in their whole bodies. Gable was in his 40s and VOLUNTEERED to go on dangerous missions in WWII. Brad meanwhile adopts kids from other countries cause it's trendy and whines about the Iraq War. Teddy Roosevelt fought in the frontlines of the Spanish American War and killed a fucking cougar with a knife. Johnny Depp bitches about how horrible America is and praises how great France is. And Dave Navarro is down there with Prince in the \"femme-man\" list. The only one of those guys with a goatee who is masculine is Bruce Willis, and he's worn a mustache at times as well. Also, he wears facial hair to compensate for his lack of head hair. He was cleanshaven before he went bald.

It's funny because.....many of the pictures shown for why mustaches are teh awesome were exactly those..... Again, there's a reason why the hipster trash have adopted the stache. They despise things they see as \"mainstream\", and go for things that nobody drinks/wears/does/etc. They love mustaches because......nobody wears them. You said it before! Class is something we as a society have forgotten.Click to expand... And you equated mustaches to class. I don't necessarily disagree with you that we have lost class. That also doesn't mean i'm gonna throw on my top hat, monocle, and tuxedo and strut around with my handlebar mustache. (on a side note, I think it's kind of funny......James Hetfield and Brad Pitt have been posted several times, on both sides of the argument. Personally, I think Hetfield looks better with a beard, and not his fu manchu. And, Pitt only had the mustache for \"Inglorious Basterds\".....he usually rocks some form of beard.) Do a google search: \"goatee is the new mullet\"Click to expand... People usually talk about the \"Stone Cold Steve Austin\" look for that though....goatee WITH a shaved head. And yes, that IS ridiculous. I agree 100% on that one. Shaved head in general, but coupled with the goat, it's awful, and so terribly popular.

April 22, 2015 I don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone when I say beards are sexy. And I\u2019m talking actual facial hair, ladies and gentleman. How many times have you seen a boy you thought was just alright grow a beard, then immediately assume the position? Check. I realized a had a beard fetish when I came home one night on my birthday, and my roommate bought be a shower curtain covered in various types of beards, with the proper name of each style, and said \u201cYou\u2019re welcome beard lady.\u201d I say \u00a0I have a \u201ctype,\u201d yet she says \u201cproblem.\u201d Tomato/tomato. Let\u2019s talk beards, shall we? Starting with my favorite, the well groomed beard. Maybe this guy is old fashioned, but I bet he could fix my car, and would probably do pretty well with my box too. And I\u2019m sure Pandora\u2019s boxxxxxx just might agree. Then there is the goatee. Super cool. If you refuse to let go of the 90\u2019s. Then there is this beauty. Now, I loved Anchorman, but I don\u2019t want to \u201clove\u201d Anchorman. Sorry Ron Burgundy. That would tickle. Stay classy. Then there is the 5 o\u2019clock shadow. Kinda hot. But looks like a fear of commitment. Looks great on Willam though! Then there is this. I could raise kids on a mountain with this one. Maybe admire his log. Cause he probably is into logging. You know, like trees. What were you guys thinking? Dirty birds. Now this is the next level. I think I just peed a little. Probably out of fear. Nope, sorry. Try again. Nope, sorry. This guy is probably a super cool dude though. Probably really good at darts too. I don\u2019t think this is an actually style of beard, just a very tan, very retired wrestler. The fuck?? Sorry Braveheart. This one doesn\u2019t even count. I quit.

The Indian players are virtually indistinguishable from each other, Kane Williamson has the ability to grow a neck beard, and David Warner has a respectable looking 'tache, possibly to give him a more serious-minded look.Those are all good tries, but the '70s remain the sexiest decade for facial hair in cricket, ammirright?

Lead [-] Beard Friendly Posts: 32 Aug 22 11 2:34 AM More My Recent Posts Tags : None I've always loved all things Star Trek and I have always been a huge fan of Cmdr. Riker, played by Jonathen Frakes. He has the coolest beard I've ever seen and when I start growing one I want it to look like his. Does anybody know what style of beard it is that he has? I've heard people call it a goat beard. But I've also heard other terms. My one worry is that the two line on each side of my mustache that run down and connect to the beard at the jaw line don't fill in all that well. There's barely anything there. It would look like a beard and a goatee with a mustache sitting up there all alone by it's self. I'll post some pictures soon so you guys can see what I mean, and it will be nice to get some good feedback of if this beard design will even work for me. Advertisement Newdles #1 [-] Beard Elite Posts: 272 Aug 22 11 2:54 AM More My Recent Posts I commend you on your choice of beard! It seems to me that Riker has a Full beard with carved out cheeks. It's a very neat and well taken care of beard. From what other people have said in the forum, connectors from the stache to the goatee can be camoflauged with long stache sides. Of course, that depends on how lacking your coverage really is or not. Regardless, good luck on your new journey! Bearded in BC #2 [-] Beard Jedi Posts: 4602 Aug 23 11 6:37 PM Honorary Beard Advocate More My Recent Posts Csalazar, I am a big Star Trek fan myself, and the Riker beard is a great look. The Riker style is exactly as Newdles mentioned a carved full beard. Here is a shot of Frakes sporting the Riker style and a rarer shot of Frakes without the deep carve: I saw Jonathan Frakes in the early 90's at a Star Trek convention. He is a very friendly guy. On a side note, he grew his beard when The Next Generation was on hiatus due to the writer's strike of the late 80's. When he returned to work bearded, Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry liked the look calling it \"nautical\" and Riker's beard was born.In regards to your own growth for doing the Riker style, it's hard to say without seeing a picture first. Newdles is correct that connector areas can be camouflaged with moustache length. A beard can also look perfectly good without connectors as well. I look forward to seeing your pics and welcome.

Bearded in BC #4 [-] Beard Jedi Posts: 4602 Aug 24 11 5:40 PM Honorary Beard Advocate More My Recent Posts CSalazar, You have plenty of growth to do a good looking beard. I also think that the Riker beard is a good goal. Just don't get too caught up in your beard being exactly the same. Each beard has its own unique qualities and part of growing a beard is accepting, and enjoying it for these as well. Give yourself at least 2-3 months to grow it out. At that point, you'll be better able to see what your beard is like. Good luck.

The bare spot you are speaking of under the chin is so very faint to me and will be easily covered with a little more growth. I also wouldn't worry about the sides of the lower lip at all. That area will simply look like you have good grooming habits once your beard grows in.

Report abuseTranscript of Facial Hair Trends From The 90'sAre they coming back into fashion? (My Opinion)Yes, I don't think they have ever gone out of fashion. I have always seen a lot of men with Soul patches and Goatees. Even lamb-chop side burns are in fashion, you just don't see that one as often.CitedFound The Different Facial Hairs & Picture Of Soul Patch: http://www.kiwianarama.co.nz/90s-facial-hair/Lamb-Chop SideburnsA man's whiskers grown down either side of the face in front of the ears.Couldn't find a lot of information.GoateesSoul Patches Facial Hair Trends From The 90'sThe soul patch is a small patch of facial hair just below the lower lip and above the chin. It came to prominence in the 1950s and 1960s, when it was a style of facial hair common among African American men, most notably jazzmen.Information about soul patch: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_patchTraditionally, the term goatee was used to refer solely to a beard formed by a tuft of hair on the chin\u2014like on the chin of a goat, hence the term 'goatee'.By the 1990s, the term was also used to refer to the style of facial hair that combines a chin beard and a short mustache there is debate over whether this style is correctly called a goatee or a Vandyke.Information About Goatee: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoateePicture Of Adam Sandler With Goatee:http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&address=105x8828373Picture of Goat: http://www.islayblog.com/2007entries/20070923-goat.shtmlSideburns Information: http://www.wordreference.com/definition/sideburnsSideburn Picture: http://www.amazon.com/Forum-Novelties-Inc-Brown-Sideburns/dp/images/B008NTM4UYFull transcriptPopular presentationsSee more popular or the latest prezisProductCompanyCareersSupportCommunityContactApps English espa\u00f1ol \ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4 \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e Deutsch Portugu\u00eas fran\u00e7ais Magyar italiano \u00a9 2017 Prezi Inc.

Eyebrows were drawn on with Sharpies, highlights were streaky, and everything had glitter in it. We tied a flannel around our waist and traveled down the nostalgia rabbit hole to find the best of the worst.By Meirav DevashApril 30, 2015Photos: Getty Imagesfacebook dialogPinterestEmailfacebook dialogPinterestSkinny BrowsIn the '90s, only Brooke Shields was allowed to have full eyebrows. Everyone else was required by law to tweeze away almost everything and then draw it back in with a superthin line. Our brave ancestors relied on their friends to survive the brow drought. Former BFFs Courtney Love and Drew Barrymore may not have had very much eyebrow left here, but they had each other.facebook dialogPinterestSkinny BrowsGwen Stefani, the embodiment of a decade, took her penciled brows one step beyond by placing a jeweled bindi between them, then adding crystals along the bottom lash line that made it look like she was crying.facebook dialogPinterestSkinny BrowsYou know what really highlights a pair of pencil-thin brows? Charlize Theron's platinum crop and tiny adolescent-style bangs.facebook dialogPinterestSkinny BrowsWe're as surprised as Pamela Anderson's eyebrows are that she dated Bret Michaels in 1994\u2014we totally repressed that memory.facebook dialogPinterestThe Fountain HeadBefore Ariana Grande and the ponytail conspiracy theories she inspired (it's a wig; she's covering a third eye in the back of her head; it's where her antennae are hidden), wearing a high ponytail fountain jutting out of the crown of your head was kind of common. Janet \"Miss Jackson If You're Nasty\" Jackson did it with long braids and a turban.facebook dialogPinterestThe Fountain HeadBritney Spears MacGyvered a white scrunchie out of...a Hanes T-shirt? A cloth diaper? Your guess is as good as ours.facebook dialogPinterestThe Fountain HeadPaula Abdul reached heights Ariana Grande could only dream of with a simple black hair wrap.facebook dialogPinterestThe Fountain HeadDanielle Fishel gave us a honey-brown hair waterfall to chase after (even though TLC warned us not to).facebook dialogPinterestWhy Tendrils? Why?Every rose had its thorn, and every updo had its tendrils. The idea was noble\u2014updos look stiff, so why not pull out some face-framing pieces to soften the look? Layering wasn't the art it is now, so the strands tended to just dangle there uselessly, slightly obstructing your vision. Julia Stiles wore the popular windshield-wiper version in 10 Things I Hate About You.facebook dialogPinterestWhy Tendrils? Why?Kate Moss glammed it up on the runway and almost pulled it off. She is Kate Moss, after all.facebook dialogPinterestWhy Tendrils? Why?Melissa Joan Hart turned one big tendril into a sagging sausage curl. Very prom-chic.facebook dialogPinterestWhy Tendrils? Why?Claire Danes worked her weird tendrils with a bob and some tiny butterfly clips.facebook dialogPinterestWhy Tendrils? Why?Jennifer Aniston went full Medusa with tendrils on tendrils and a Claire's Accessories store's worth of tiny hair clips.facebook dialogPinterestPorcupine UpdosAnother way to make your updo more exciting was to make sure the ends of your hair were spiky instead of tucking them in with bobby pins. This way, they poked out in all directions and confused the eye. Claire Danes got a young Leonardo DiCaprio's attention with these broomlike bristles.facebook dialogPinterestPorcupine UpdosCourteney Cox's sprouts were the more relaxed version.facebook dialogPinterestPorcupine UpdosAlicia Silverstone combined spikes with tendrils and butterfly clips for a '90s-trend trifecta.facebook dialogPinterestBlue Eye-Shadow OverloadThe thing about wearing '90s blue eye shadow is that basically any amount is too much. (Need we remind you of the Mimi Bobeck character on The Drew Carey Show?) Here, baby Reese Witherspoon looks like she got into her mom's makeup bag and went to town.facebook dialogPinterestBlue Eye-Shadow OverloadJennifer Lopez brought her frosty blue shadow all the way up to the brow.facebook dialogPinterestBlue Eye-Shadow OverloadBack in her dark, edgy days, Angelina Jolie went for the clown-paint approach: pale skin, high arches, and a creepy Joker smile.facebook dialogPinterestSo Much Body GlitterDuring this weird blip in time, decorating yourself with glitter powders, gels, and sprays was acceptable\u2014even encouraged. And no one thought this made them look like a stripper. Britney Spears liberally applied body glitter to her d\u00e9collet\u00e9 and shoulders, creating a vaguely sweaty effect.facebook dialogPinterestCrunchy HairBefore co-washing and sulfate awareness, most hair products had the same alcohol content as Everclear. Texture was really important, whether you rocked braids, waves, or crispy curls. (Touchability, not so much.) Cameron Diaz hit the crimping iron hard for this Top Ramen hair look.facebook dialogPinterestCrunchy HairChristina Aguilera fluffed her egg-noodle curls up and out and set them with shellac.facebook dialogPinterestCrunchy HairLook at Kirsten Dunst! Her shiny zigzags are crisp and hot off the crimper.facebook dialogPinterestCrunchy HairOne way to get crimps without hot tools was to put your hair in braids before going to sleep. Looks like Kate Moss was about to do just that (after putting out her cigarette).facebook dialogPinterestCrazy Accent BraidsCoachella, shmoachella. The '90s had its own brand of boho hair, and it didn't involve wearing an oversize floral crown. Randomly placed braids were one way to signify that you were laid-back, maaaan. Madonna's take was very Sea Hag Chic: center-parted, disheveled beach waves with ropy braids.facebook dialogPinterestCrazy Accent BraidsScarlett Johansson's hair wraps were like wearing friendship bracelets in your hair.facebook dialogPinterestCrazy Accent BraidsFiona Apple decided to wear all the hair textures\u2014straight, frizzy, curly, and braided\u2014for a raised-by-wolves vibe.facebook dialogPinterestCulturally Insensitive CornrowsWe all went to the Bahamas in 1994 and collectively had the same terrible idea. Let's just pretend this never happened, OK, Juliette Lewis?facebook dialogPinterestCulturally Insensitive CornrowsYou too, Melissa Joan Hart.facebook dialogPinterestBrown LipstickNot red, not pink, but grungy brown lips were the thing. (There were so many lipsticks named after cocoa and raisins.) Women were drawn to the color because it was dark and moody, but not as try-hard as a vampy berry or goth burgundy. Mostly, it looked...muddy. T-Boz, Left-Eye, and Chilli of TLC all took time away from stapling condoms to their clothes to swipe it on.facebook dialogPinterestBrown LipstickJulianne Moore looked like she was colored in with an auburn crayon\u2014her hair, eyebrows, smoky eye shadow, and lipstick were somehow all the same shade.facebook dialogPinterestBrown LipstickJennifer Lopez gave her lips a coat of glossy wood varnish.facebook dialogPinterestBrown LipstickDrew Barrymore went totally matte. A gray-blue undertone in the color helped simulate hypothermia.facebook dialogPinterestBrown LipstickAnd then there was that frosted nude-mauve color that wasn't brown but definitely didn't look nude. It seems like Tori Spelling, Shannen Doherty, and Jennie Garth all shared the same tube of lipstick at this party, and it's the most '90s thing we've ever seen.facebook dialogPinterestTwo BarrettesCourtney Love, riot grrrls, and double-dutch jumpers had already called dibs on plastic barrettes. Then Jennifer Lopez really classed up the idea of doing your hair like an eight-year-old by adding diamonds.facebook dialogPinterestTwo BarrettesSalma Hayek wore double barrettes to a Giorgio Armani fashion show, but she looked like she was already rethinking it.facebook dialogPinterestMini BunsIt's around this time that women started wondering if wearing one bun was enough. Maybe the more, the better? Bj\u00f6rk started the trend, and everyone was charmed because she's an adorable little Icelandic pixie who wears way weirder stuff all the time.facebook dialogPinterestMini BunsGwen Stefani wore them, too, and everyone was already used to her half-shirt and bindi, so they let it slide.facebook dialogPinterestMini BunsBy the time Reese Witherspoon used baby buns to spice up her mom bob, the tide had already turned.facebook dialogPinterestMini BunsSorry, Heather Graham.facebook dialogPinterestChunky HighlightsEveryone got highlights in the '90s, and they wanted to make sure you knew it. Lightened sections were big, bright, and super-obvious. Gwyneth Paltrow and Brad Pitt were unforgettable in their his-and-hers zebra stripes.facebook dialogPinterestChunky HighlightsGeri Halliwell of the Spice Girls bleached just the front. The two-tone look was what she wanted, what she really, really wanted.facebook dialogPinterestChunky HighlightsJennie Garth applied her highlights with a paint roller.facebook dialogPinterestChunky HighlightsCourteney Cox tried it with darker colors in wine and brown. Still weird.facebook dialogPinterestEverything Is Wrong HereBehold, A.J. Langer from My So-Called Life, who wore every '90s beauty trend at the same time.

Mandatory // Play Today\u2019s MLB Sluggers With \u201990s Style Goatees Don't be afraid of the chin hair, fellas. by Gary Dudak Aug 19th, 2015 The \u201990s were a great time for the long ball, when Major League Baseball players regularly hit 50+ home runs and defied traditional power numbers. It was also a great time for the goatee, with sluggers like Mark McGwire, Jeff Bagwell, Ken Caminiti and Larry Walker regularly sporting them. This carried into the early 2000s with guys like Albert Pujols, but it seems to be lost on most of today\u2019s best hitters. That\u2019s a damn shame, too, because obviously they would look way more badass, as you can clearly see below.

Subject: Are mullets and goatees 90's things? Written By: 1993 on 03/16/06 at 9:58 pm I'm pretty certain the goatee is something that returned exclusively in the 90's, I don't remember it ever being popular in the 80's. In the 70's and 60's you had some long, shaggy growths, but usually they were moustache's, full beards, or the fu man chu stache...not goatees. The 20's-30's-40's-50's were all super clean shaven for the most part. I believe Taft was the last President to even have facial hair. So the goatee came back from an era pre dates even the 1900's. The mullet is sort of a tweener in my eye. It wasn't popular early 80's, crept into the culture in the mid to late 80's. I think it probably reached its peak around 89-90 when boys would actually grow \"rat tails\" down the back. Imagine a crew cut with a long rat tail down between the shoulder blades...I saw it all. Mullets were still acceptable probably up until 1994, I even remember seeing some in 1995, but by then the longish bowl haircut with the part down the middle started to take command. Subject: Re: Are mullets and goatees 90's things?

Written By: Marty McFly on 03/17/06 at 2:55 am I think mullets started getting popular around 1982, but you're right, the late '80s always seemed more synonymous with them (i.e. people often rag on Richard Marx - who peaked around 1987-91 - for having a mullet and being a \"soft rocker\"). ;D\"Straight\" mustaches (i.e. think Alex Trebek on Jeopardy, until he shaved it off recently) do seem like an '80s thing. Alof of guys had them, especially without having any other kind of facial hair.I'd also agree on goatees. Subject: Re: Are mullets and goatees 90's things?

Written By: whistledog on 03/17/06 at 8:15 pm I once got in an argument with a guy over at The 80s Server who was convinced that Mullets were a 90's thing.\u00a0 They date back to the 70's, and I even gave him proof, but he still wouldn't believe ;D Subject: Re: Are mullets and goatees 90's things? Written By: Chris MegatronTHX on 03/18/06 at 12:25 am I'm pretty certain the goatee is something that returned exclusively in the 90's, I don't remember it ever being popular in the 80's. In the 70's and 60's you had some long, shaggy growths, but usually they were moustache's, full beards, or the fu man chu stache...not goatees. The 20's-30's-40's-50's were all super clean shaven for the most part. I believe Taft was the last President to even have facial hair. So the goatee came back from an era pre dates even the 1900's. The mullet is sort of a tweener in my eye. It wasn't popular early 80's, crept into the culture in the mid to late 80's. I think it probably reached its peak around 89-90 when boys would actually grow \"rat tails\" down the back. Imagine a crew cut with a long rat tail down between the shoulder blades...I saw it all. Mullets were still acceptable probably up until 1994, I even remember seeing some in 1995, but by then the longish bowl haircut with the part down the middle started to take command. The people who had those kind of hairstyles generally came from a redneck culture.\u00a0 They didn't care if they were wearing a 1982 hairstlye in 1995. Subject: Re: Are mullets and goatees 90's things? Written By: velvetoneo on 03/18/06 at 2:31 pm The '70s were the moustache decade, every guy in the '70s tried a moustache at least once (including my father, yuck, old college pictures of him) and even a beard. They sort of went out except for the Prince-style moustache in the '80s, never to really come back. Mullets are very '80s, though they survived to the early '90s and rednecks still wear that hairstyle. Goatees always struck me as a late-1991+ sort of thing that died c. 2002.

Written By: Ryan112390 on 06/08/10 at 10:15 am Going by my own experiences and observations of culture--Mullets were popular in various forms from the early 70s-late 80s; In the late 80s they achieved mainstream popularity in the styles we know now, not the 70s experimental mullet styles. My father had one in 1984 (combined with a horseshoe mustache), and then had from straight from 1989-1996, which is when he cut his hair.\u00a0 I'd put the mid 90s as the cut off, because by the late 90s they were already being mocked in mainstream culture.;Goatees I've noticed in movies were usually, especially in the 80s, on the face of evil guys (think ''Evil Spock'' from the 60s for example.) but sometime around 1989-1991, they began to appear on the 20 something year olds faces and were popular with Generation Xers by around 1995; I'd sayby\u00a0 around 1998-1999 they became HUGE in general outside of Gen X and have been since.The 30s, 40s, 70s and 80s were the decades of the mustache. In the 30s-40s you had hundreds of them throughout Hollywood (on the faces of Clark Gable, Ronald Coleman, Errol Flynn, Walt Disney, David Niven) but by the '50s had disappeared except on the faces of men who had had them since the '30s. In the 50s goatees were popular for some time with Beatniks and counter cultural figures but associated with Maynard Krebs by the mainstream public. In the mid 60s the mustache reappeared and by the mid 70s was the facial hair of choice for men who wished to convey a sense of authority or masculinity, and this continued into the 80s with Tom Selleck and others; Suddenly, in the 90s, the mustache became identified more with the Village People (who wore them to mock the masculinity of them) or Ned Flanders in the 90s and had a steep decline in popularity; Many who had mustaches either shaved them, or turned them into goatees.

The 70s saw the rise of sideburns, and the 80s introduced us to the magic of the moustache, a style that saw a recent revival laden in irony.\u00a0The 1990s\u00a0were dominated by the crisp, clean look of a well-maintained goatee.\u00a0Art has been said to imitate life, and vice versa. In the\u00a090s, no artist resonated as heartily with the modern public like professional wrestler \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin.\u00a0Stone Cold spent his nights beating up his boss, chugging beer, and serving up Stone Cold Stunners to anyone that dared step into the ring with him. And he did it all while sporting the iconic goatee.\u00a0The sports world took notice,\u00a0and the decade was dominated by athletes putting their best face forward, one that often featured a finely maintained outline of hair starting just below the nose and ending on the chin.\u00a0In honor of \"The Rattlesnake\",\u00a0in no particular order,\u00a0here are the top nine athlete\u00a0goatees of the 90s.\u00a0Owen NolanThere is a silly rumor out there that Owen Nolan was born with a goatee. This could not be further from the truth. In reality, Owen Nolan's goatee came first\u00a0and he grew up around it.\u00a0Gary PaytonGary Payton's goatee took no mess. An infamous trash-talker, The Glove's manicured mouth-curtain served to give a frame of reference to opposing guards as to where the stream of expletives being thrown at them was coming from.\u00a0Mike PiazzaThe greatest hitting catcher of his generation, Piazza perplexed pitchers with a seemingly\u00a0impossibly well-maintained goatee. Over the course of 16\u00a0years he ran the gamut of upper-lip maintenance, but never looked as much at home as he did with a classic New York goatee.\u00a0Jeff BagwellJeff Bagwell had a lovely 15-year career, with 449 home runs and a .297/.408/.540 line, making a fun debate about whether or not he deserves to be in the Baseball Hall of Fame. What can't be debated is that Bagwell was a goatee connoisseur, seeming to draw his power from the ugliness hanging off his chin.\u00a0Tupac ShakurOkay, technically Pac wasn't an athlete, he did star as Birdie, a local thug in the movie Above The Rim. It would be shortsighted to not include Tupac in any list honoring the most influential figures on the 90s, and equally shortsighted to minimize the role his Van Dyke played in sculpting the faces of future generations.Scott Stevens\u00a0New Jersey Devils defenceman Scott Stevens was, above all else, absolutely terrifying. Known for delivering borderline murderous body checks, Stevens marched to his own drum. When\u00a0others\u00a0grew playoff beards, he sported the playoff goatee. Seeing Stevens\u00a0with a goatee meant one thing: it was time to keep your head up.\u00a0Karl Malone6-foot-9 and 250 pounds, the Mailman's goatee was there to outline an immovable scowl. Though Malone would often play around with the thin moustache and full beard look, he never looked so comfortable and angry as he\u00a0did with a bold full goatee.Alexi LalasWhen the USA hosted the 1994 World Cup\u00a0a nation was introduced to soccer. The conduit for the beautiful game was the\u00a0hideous facial hair of American defender Alexi Lalas. \"This is what soccer is,\" Lalas' goatee seemed to exclaim. \"Trust me, you'll love it in 20 years.\"Mark McGwireMark McGwire thrust himself into the hearts and minds of the general public in 1998 with the great home run race against Sammy Sosa. Sporting a goatee that looked like a carbon of the one on Patron Saint Stone Cold, McGwire closed out the decade strongly reinforcing that the 90s unequivocally belonged to the goatee. theScore.com Advertisement Related Articles Pranksters who posed as strongman duo on morning news show being sued Pranksters who posed as strongman duo on morning news show being sued Top News 9h ago Stephen A.

Soul Patches The soul patch is, arguably, the most illogical of all 90's trends. The chin strap beard, while stupid, clearly said, \"I do too have a chin. I outlined it in my face hair. See?\" The goatee wordlessly declared, \"I'm an assh*le!\" So what did a soul patch say? \"The only thing I follow more religiously than minor league baseball is trends involving confused displays of masculinity.\" If you ever had a soul patch, please take a moment to stew in your shame. If you still have a soul patch, you've got a little barbecue sauce in there. 2. JNCOs Perhaps it was because of all of the Skip-It related chafing wounds, or just a general fondness for the feel of perpetually filthy shreds of fabric flopping against your calves, but, in the 90's, nothing was cooler than going to Kohl's with your mom to buy a fly new pair of JNCOs. WAS, being the operative word. We can all agree now that the circumference of your \"pipes\" should not exceed the length of your inseam. It just looks stupid. It doesn't matter how many yo-yo's you had stashed in there; no one needs that much room in their pants. 3. Leather Pants No one who was over the age of 11 at any point in the 90's made it through the decade without wondering, \"Could I pull off leather pants?\" The answer, ubiquitously, was, \"No,\" but Ricky Martin, Crazy Spice, and the actresses on Charmed were unrelenting in their desire to make leather pants last. In the end, the insane dry cleaning bills and the fact that you can't take anyone in leather pants seriously defeated this terrible trend. Just in case: no. You can't pull off leather pants. Don't try to bring them back. No. 4. Thug Looney Tunes Shirts Nothing proves the collective idiocy of the 90's more than the fact that a group of businessmen thought, \"People will probably buy T-shirts with Looney Tunes characters dressed in 'urban' attire,\" and then people actually bought them. This fad predated the safety mechanism of ironic fashion. If you wore an oversized T-shirt with a picture of Bugs Bunny wearing baggy, backwards jeans, you genuinely thought it was cool. At some point in the 90's, at least one person was probably held at gun point by someone in a gangster Tasmanian Devil T-shirt. Just think about that and vow to never let this fashion trend return. 5. Backwards Jeans Why was Bugs Bunny dressed in backwards jeans? Oh yeah. Because that was a thing people did. Specifically \"Mac Daddy\" and \"Daddy Mac\" of the hip-hop group Kris Kross. They are to blame for countless misplaced beepers and chaos at junior high urinals. This is the kind of trend that can only be discussed by using the phrase \"youth culture\" in the most crotchety tone of distanced disparagement, but, come on, you tried your jeans on backwards. Just don't try it again. Page 1 of 5Next Filed Under: soul patch90sLists Comments We like you. Do you like us too? Don't ask me again.

Maybe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not releasing any new material so watching them now promises to be only marginally more exciting than checking in with Kurt Cobain. \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0Or maybe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because their return was so unexpected, it's left me reeling with uncertainty.\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, what else from the 90's will return? Here are five fearless predictions: Advertisement 1. Lilith Fair Back in the mid 90\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bunch of ladies saw the success of Lollapalooza and decided to show the world that sisters could do it for themselves.\u00c2\u00a0 Soon a group of somewhat talented artists banded together united only by their one hit wonder status and lack of a penis.\u00c2\u00a0 Shawn Colvin, Meredith Brooks, Paula Cole, and others.\u00c2\u00a0 (I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d include Sarah McLachlan, but she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s had more than one hit and that would ruin my wild generalization.\u00c2\u00a0 Also, she never replied after I wrote that letter about kissing her so hard, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just going to assume she actually does have \u00c2\u00a0a penis.) Well in 2010, Lillith Fair will return with a vengeance.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 And not with Lady Gaga and Ke$ha flying the grrl-power banner. \u00c2\u00a0No, instead, our old friends will take to the stage with new anthems like Brooks\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a Bitch (Just Like This Menopause);\u00c2\u00a0 Colvin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cSonny Never Visits Anymore;\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 and Paula Cole\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cPiss Off Gladstone, I Had Two Hits.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The feisty music-loving college girls of the 90s will now be able to purchase tickets at Starbucks, Talbots, and, of course, Gymboree. 2. Bad Sex I hesitate to go here because after the Lillith Fair cracks I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d hate to be misunderstood as a misogynist.\u00c2\u00a0 But being misunderstood is what writing for the internet is all about.\u00c2\u00a0 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like a big game of \u00e2\u0080\u009cTelephone\u00e2\u0080\u009d that you play only with your deaf friends.\u00c2\u00a0 Who are also neurologically impaired. \u00c2\u00a0So here goes.\u00c2\u00a0 I know it may come as a surprise to you 21st century boys and girls, but women were different in the 90\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\u00c2\u00a0 This was before Sex and the City feminism took hold. Today, women hold onto the false delusion that they can empower themselves by tweeting \u00c2\u00a0frankly about how much they enjoy \u00c2\u00a0oral sex.\u00c2\u00a0 Where a frattish mentality of getting drunk and laid is somehow akin to saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a woman and I will not be denied !\u00e2\u0080\u009d Now, of course that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wrong-headed and false, but men don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t typically try to dispel that notion because, well why would we dissuade you from talking about oral sex?\u00c2\u00a0 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s much easier for dudes to say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re an independent woman. Now finish your beer and do that thing I like with the thing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But back in the 90\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, it was a different scene.\u00c2\u00a0 Intelligent, sexual women across the land (or at least at my University) wanted to run with the wolves while reading Naomi Wolfe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Beauty Myth.\u00c2\u00a0 They couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t put on make up or shave their legs without asking, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy am I doing this; are these the tools of my oppression; and how does Gladstone get so dreamy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the stats to prove this, but in the 90\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fewer asses got spanked during sex then any decade in modern history.\u00c2\u00a0 The 69 rose in prominence as the only accepted egalitarian form of oral sex. And for the first time in history, a frank dialogue about the magic and glory of the menses was considered foreplay. Well, get ready, because in 2010, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all coming back.\u00c2 \u2193 Continue Reading Below Sex and the City 2 will hit theaters and suddenly women will react in horror at the lifeless shell Carrie Bradshaw has become.\u00c2\u00a0 Soon Ani DiFranco records will start to sell again and French maid outfits will be returned in record numbers.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Your free ride is over fellas. Time to grow a pony tail and get some Indigo Girls records. 3. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThanks for Sharing\u00e2\u0080\u009d/\u00e2\u0080\u009dToo Much Information\u00e2\u0080\u009d Historians tell us that for a brief six week period in the fall of 1991, it was actually considered somewhat witty and/or clever to say \u00e2\u0080\u009cthanks for sharing\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009ctoo much information\u00e2\u0080\u009d when confronted with unwanted details from another\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal life.\u00c2\u00a0 We may never know why humor was ascribed to these phrases, but all our best data tells us it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true.\u00c2\u00a0 Indeed, even today, there are still clusters of humorless conversation trolls who feel empowered by using \u00c2\u00a0these phrases as if they were magical incantations, instantly transforming \u00c2\u00a0the speaker into a person more important than the addressee.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 They have no idea that every self-respecting human stopped saying this shortly before the start of the Clinton administration. Well they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in luck.\u00c2\u00a0 In 2010, a void will form in our language and welcome the unfortunate return of these phrases.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0Why?\u00c2\u00a0 Because in 2010 \u00e2\u0080\u009cFail\u00e2\u0080\u009d will finally leave the vernacular.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 (Incidentally, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmeh\u00e2\u0080\u009d will hold tight for another five years.) Soon, millions of the worst people in the world will be unsure what to say when being exposed to unexpected, unwanted information.\u00c2\u00a0 And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s when the TMI jargon returns. Some of you may be doubting this prediction.\u00c2\u00a0 How does it make sense to reply \u00e2\u0080\u009cthanks for sharing\u00e2\u0080\u009d to a youtube video you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t approve of? \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0Well , in truth, it makes no sense.\u00c2\u00a0 But then again, it was never really logical to say \u00e2\u0080\u009ctoo much information\u00e2\u0080\u009d to your co-worker when he was trying to open up to you about the death of his mother either. 4. Goatees Did you misread that? Not Goatse. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a 21st century creation.\u00c2\u00a0 No, I said \u00e2\u0080\u009cgoatee\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that tiny beard circling one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mouth that --much like Goatse-- \u00c2\u00a0actually does conjure thoughts of a-holes.\u00c2\u00a0 But in the 90\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it was part of the standard uniform.\u00c2\u00a0 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to believe, but just over a decade ago, this incomplete facial hair formation, could actually increase a guy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chances of having sex \u00e2\u0080\u0093 especially when coupled with long hair.\u00c2\u00a0 It was a look that said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey world, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a beard. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not clean-shaven either.\u00c2\u00a0 You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t define me with your boring rules. \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00c2\u00a0 And seriously what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sexier than that? In 2010, the goatee comes back stronger than ever. Why? Because of this column.\u00c2\u00a0 The power of the internet, baby.\u00c2\u00a0 Tomorrow morning, every guy who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s read this will stare in his bathroom mirror overcome by a certain sensation.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood lord, Gladstone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s onto something!\u00c2\u00a0 What if the ladies couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see the skin immediately around my mouth?\u00c2\u00a0 What if it appeared from the proper distance that I had a cinnamon donut stuck to my face?\u00c2\u00a0 Good lord, how much tail would that get me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 You may doubt it now, but it's already in play.\u00c2\u00a0 You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re already on your way. Congratulations, sexy! In fact, I just started a facebook group called \u00e2\u0080\u009cGoatees for 2010\u00e2\u0080\u009d to get this baby going.\u00c2\u00a0 If the group gets, over 100 members with pics posted, I promise to post too. (I understand it will take a few days to get the facial hair in place).\u00c2\u00a0 I will also do my best to get the other Cracked columnists to do so \u00e2\u0080\u0093 understanding, of course that Daniel O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Brien and Michael Swaim may lack the testerone-based fortitude to achieve such things. 5. Full House Hey remember one of the worst sitcoms ever? No? Why? Because you were 5? Oh.\u00c2\u00a0 Well what about syndication? Yes, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m talking about Full House. That show about a Jewish guy who was somehow named Tanner and not actually Jewish who had to raise two baby troll dolls after his wife died. Thinking fast, he recruits John Stamos and Dave Coulier to help out.\u00c2\u00a0 The show ran from 1987 to 1995 and I imagine it sucked the entire length of that time, but truth be told, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure I ever saw a full episode. In any event, in 2010, Full House returns.\u00c2\u00a0 Not a remake.\u00c2\u00a0 All the same actors return in modern day.\u00c2\u00a0 The make-shift family will reunite to help the Olson twins deal with their eating disorders.\u00c2\u00a0 Bob Saget, once known for being funny and one of the dirtiest stand ups prior to Full House, will now drop F bombs non stop.\u00c2\u00a0 And Dave Coulier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s catch phrase will be \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey, y\u00e2\u0080\u0099know Alanis Morrissette was totally talking about going down on me in that theater.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe me?\u00c2\u00a0 Doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sound right for TV? What if I told you the cast did the whole show in black face and it was called Tyler Perry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Full House of Payne?\u00c2\u00a0 Yep. Believe it.\u00c2\u00a0 Enjoy your 2010, guys.

Even in the heat of the summer, the hairy trend continues to prevail. Still, if you think that\u2019s crazy, you probably missed the \u201990s. From about 1990-1998, some very weird facial hairstyles dominated the music world. There were a lot of incomplete goatees and quite a few runaway beards. Don\u2019t believe us? Check out some of the craziest and most \u201990s facial hair below\u2013 but we\u2019re warning you, you can never un-see what you\u2019re about to witness. 1 The Floating Goatee Getty Images A goatee is just a small patch of hair located on the chin. Seemingly simple, yet in the \u201990s, a lot of musicians literally missed the mark. John Dolmayan style was the perfect example of this nonchalant look, he had a soul patch just above his chin, so it wasn\u2019t quite a goatee, but it can\u2019t be disregarded all together. Hence, a new category is born: \u201cthe floater.\u201d 2 The Chin Mane Getty Images This exaggerated style still lives on today\u2013 ahem, Brad Pitt\u2013 but it was all the rage for rockers back in the day. Anthrax\u2019s lead guitarist Scott Ian not only sported this look, but he often dyed his mane. We\u2019re guessing to match his mood. 3 The Braided Beard Getty Images Shavo Odadjian clearly takes the cake when it comes to braided beards. The man had facial hair longer than the hair on most people\u2019s head. It wasn\u2019t a good luck, but it was very \u201990s. 4 The Landing Strip @artalexakis This style is pretty self-explanatory. It\u2019s a thin strip of hair that starts under the lip and ends wherever it wants. Please look to Art Alexakis for reference. The dad of three still rocks his classic style although no one else has since 1998. 5 Animal Style Sideburns Getty Images Sideburns alone aren\u2019t a \u201990s trend, but grooming those bad boys to your jawline? That\u2019s something that most men avoid these days. Back in his Limp Bizkit prime, Wes Borland sported some of the creepiest sideburns we\u2019ve ever seen. (Seriously, if his appearance in the \u201cNookie\u201d video doesn\u2019t haunt you, we don\u2019t know what will.) 6 The Hourglass Conundrum Getty Images Fred Durst rocked this style loud and proud in the \u201990s. His thin and oddly shaped beard closely resembled an hourglass. 7 The Dot Getty Images This style is similar to the \u201cfloating goatee\u201d with considerably less effort. As the name suggests, it is a literal dash of hair under your lip. Not very logical, but it was a trend all the same. 8 The 3-piece Masterpiece: A Combination Style [image src=\"wp-attachment://46414\"] Although this style combines three already horrible looks on the list, it has to stand on it\u2019s own for all of the musicians who rocked this exact look. Late Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain wore it best. Not only did Kurt\u2019s mustache connect to his beard, but he took it a step further by having a thin, two-part goatee that wasn\u2019t connected to anything.

                            "text": "Music Film Television Books Webcomics Current Events Consumerism Podcast The 9 Worst Legacies of \u201990s Pop Culture July 24, 2013 Chris Holmes Facebook Twitter Chris Holmes joined the Popdose writing staff only after enduring a humiliating series of hazing rituals. One day he'll write a tell-all book, and then they'll all pay. Until then, you can also catch him at his regular home, The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit, or you can follow him on Twitter. Most unfortunate pop culture trends from the \u201990s are dead and gone, but here are nine that live on like annoying zombies. The good thing about pop culture trends is that most of them, while shitty, go away eventually. But some of them, like that nasty case of herpes you picked up your freshman year in college, never really vanish for good. They either hang around undiluted or just morph into something slightly different. Here are nine such pop culture legacies from a decade that couldn\u2019t end quickly enough if you ask me: the \u201990s. Note for the nitpickers: While some of these things did not necessarily begin in the 1990s, they came to prominence then. So there. The Goatee If you\u2019re reading this and are currently sporting a goatee, do the rest of us a favor and shave that shit off. Right now. What the pornstache was to the \u201970s or the mullet was to the \u201980s, the goatee was to the \u201990s \u2014 a grooming relic best left to those painfully unfunny VH1 retrospective clip shows. The only people who can still get away with that look are actors, athletes, and Evil Spock. So either be a man and commit to the full beard like the rest of us or be done with it. Beanie Babies Now worth DOZENS of dollars. To be fair, Beanie Babies weren\u2019t the first useless item people lost their collective shit over; nor will they be the last. But with most hot toys, the secondary market explodes because the manufacturer can\u2019t keep up with demand. What made Beanie Babies especially annoying (and therefore worthy of this list) was that Ty Inc. artificially kept the supply of individual animals low by \u201cretiring\u201d them. Because God forbid they produce a few thousand more stuffed ducks to prevent a bunch of bored housewives from rioting. This kind of bullshit marketing ploy is now commonplace, to the point where every piece of junk companies pump out is instantly labeled a collector\u2019s item. The absolute nadir of the Beanie Baby craze came in 1996, the first year of the McDonald\u2019s Teenie Beanie Apocalypse. People waited on line for hours and even got into fights, all for the privilege of owning a smaller version of an already useless stuffed toy. But this story does have a happy ending. All those little sacks of stuffing that were treated like gold back then are now no more valuable than most other toys from the era. A recent eBay auction for 65 Teenie Beanies sold for a whopping $23.01. Even that\u2019s a ripoff if you ask me. Adam Sandler Twice as douchetastic. It\u2019s not that I think Adam Sandler lacks talent. He was pretty funny on Saturday Night Live, and I never pass up an opportunity to watch The Wedding Singer on cable. But if there\u2019s an entertainer from the \u201990s who has squeezed more out of his blatantly limited range of ability, I can\u2019t think of one. My brain cannot process the fact that the guy who I first saw as a funny but fairly forgettable bit player on the old Remote Control game show was given money by Hollywood to release a hateful piece of shit like Jack and Jill a few decades later. It\u2019s like his level of success is inversely proportional to how insultingly stupid his projects are. Worst of all, Adam Sandler is the sole reason Rob Schneider isn\u2019t giving handies for meth money in some dank Hollywood alley. I will never forgive him for that. Country Pop I\u2019ll admit that I was never a huge country fan to begin with, but I can at least respect the old school. Johnny Cash, Hank Williams, Willie Nelson, and Waylon Jennings \u2014 this to me is what country music is all about. Not the homogenized, twangy pop pabulum that\u2019s come to represent the genre over the last 20-plus years. Sure, there\u2019s been a huge strain of pop music intertwined with country going all the way back to the days of Countrypolitan in the \u201950s and \u201960s. But Shania Twain, Billy Ray Cyrus, Carrie Underwood, and Taylor Swift? Are you sure Hank done it this way? Multiple Covers Four different covers of X-Men #1. Like a license to print Nerd Bucks. This crap may not have started in the comic book industry, but it sure took hold in a big way there. Publishers realized that they had a hot thing on their hands and, as executives are wont to do, got greedy. Want to move a lot of product but can\u2019t be bothered with writing more stories? Just publish the same damn issue multiple times and slap a different cover on each one. Genius! But it doesn\u2019t stop there, and it hasn\u2019t stopped yet. While a case could possibly be made for wanting multiple comic book covers, I can think of no good excuse for the same from esteemed publications like TV Guide or Cosmopolitan. And yet here we are. Three times as pointless. The Death of Mass Cultural Experiences This one may be a bit of a reach, but work with me. Depending on your viewpoint, the explosion of cable television, the internet, and musical choices in the \u201990s was a double-edged sword. On the one hand, people had more choices than ever before for entertainment. But the downside, as far as I\u2019m concerned anyway, is that the age of the shared cultural experience died for good. Take music as an example, think about it \u2014 what bands have come along since the \u201990s that have effectively taken over our mass consciousness, even if for a little while? I would argue that since Michael Jackson\u2019s heyday, or perhaps even Prince or Bruce Springsteen, you don\u2019t get acts that sell a shit ton of albums and are also impossible to ignore. These days \u2014 and I\u2019m veering dangerously close to Bob Lefsetz territory, admittedly \u2014 the music market is so fragmented that very few top-selling acts actually seep into the brains of non-fans. The same goes for TV. The final episode of M*A*S*H aired in 1983 and drew 125+ million viewers, or seventy-seven percent of all American TV viewers. The only series finale from the last decade to crack the top 10 of that list was for Friends, which drew less than half the viewers and just over half the market share. And I\u2019d wager that more people remember watching the M*A*S*H finale. That\u2019s not to say that we don\u2019t still have extremely popular media. But more and more, the people who enjoy a band or a book or a show are all already fans, and they\u2019re all high-fiving each other in the same little silo. I think the Harry Potter franchise did achieve that breakthrough, so perhaps I\u2019m being premature here. OK, back to the snark. Cash Cow Band Reunions The next time you purchase (or try to) a ticket for a so-called legacy act and then realize that you\u2019d need to sell a few pints of blood just to cover the convenience charge, thank these douchebags: Well at least the two d-bags in the middle. By the time the Eagles hit the road for their Hell Freezes Over tour in 1994, they turned out to be the beneficiaries of a unique convergence between music and demographics. Their core fanbase, the Baby Boomers, were cruising into middle age and their prime earning years, and were more than willing to spend triple figures to relive their youth. Which would be all well and good, but it turned out that Messrs. Henley and friends had little interest in recording new music. In fact it would be 13 years before the reformed band released a proper studio album. In the meantime they went on two more massive, highly lucrative tours. Other bands followed suit in the following years, such as Kiss, the Who, and even the Police. Of course I\u2019m a willing accomplice to an extent, having seen Kiss twice in \u201996 and the Police in 2007, but I can tell you neither was cheap. Collecting As a Business Instead of a Hobby \u201cI\u2019ll go $5 on the Barry Bonds rookie card, but if even one corner is bent I\u2019ll break your legs.\u201d I remember the day I realized that comic books had stopped being fun, and it had nothing to do with finally kissing a girl. I was in one of those permanent flea markets, looking for an old issue of The Avengers\u00a0or Archie or something like that. I walked toward the counter and saw a kid, who couldn\u2019t have been more than 8 or 9 years old, haggling with the store owner over a comic like he was trying to broker a peace deal at Camp David. I put my stuff back, walked out, and never came back. By the 1990s, comic books and sports cards had stopped being pieces of colorful paper for kids and adult fans to accrue and enjoy. They became commodities to be hoarded, speculated on, and dealt like shares of stock or bars of gold. You didn\u2019t dare handle one too much for fear of losing value. This is partly to blame for what turned into the comic book bubble of the early \u201990s. (For more on that, read any of the great and insightful essays by Mile High Comics founder Chuck Rozanski.) Likewise, baseball cards underwent a similar boom period, only to crash in the \u201990s. It\u2019s why cards that you spent a few dozen dollars on then can be had for a fraction of that now on eBay. And while that\u2019s probably as it should be, it just sucks that what was supposed to be a fun hobby turned countless kids into little Gordon Gekkos* in the process. *I\u2019m old and out of touch. Can someone give me a more current reference point for greed than Gordon Gekko? EXTREME (not the band) I get it. Attitude sells. It\u2019s been the case for decades. My main issue with the still-quite-pervasive trend of marketing things as \u201cextreme\u201d is that most of them just aren\u2019t. It\u2019s really just a cynical attempt by corporate executives to dupe people into believing that they have have had instant coolness imbued upon them just by consuming one mass-marketed product over another. Take, for example, one of the prime offenders in the realm of EXTREME marketing \u2014 Mountain Dew. Oh sorry, I meant Mtn. Dew. Here\u2019s one of their decidedly un-extreme \u00a0TV spots from the mid \u201980s. Not very in your face, is it? But add some screaming guitars, extreme cross-training (another fucking term I can\u2019t get enough of), and a de-mulleted tennis star, and you\u2019re ready to ditch those rednecks and DO THE DEW. While Agassi may be gone, the extreme-ness remains. And since the \u201990s it has spread like a damn virus to just about every consumer product imaginable \u2014 from jeans to snack chips to baby carrots. Yes, not even\u00a0baby carrots\u00a0are immune to the X-Games-ification of American culture.

                            "text": "nineties Share on facebook Tweet it Top News The top-9 athlete goatees of the 90s Andrew Zuber July 17, 2014 2:20pm Mario Anzuoni / REUTERS Facial hair, like all fashion trends, comes in and out of style in a cycle.\u00a0The modern hip way for men to decorate their face is the unkempt beard, a revival of the style that dominated the wild and untamed 1960s. The 70s saw the rise of sideburns, and the 80s introduced us to the magic of the moustache, a style that saw a recent revival laden in irony.\u00a0The 1990s\u00a0were dominated by the crisp, clean look of a well-maintained goatee.\u00a0Art has been said to imitate life, and vice versa. In the\u00a090s, no artist resonated as heartily with the modern public like professional wrestler \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin.\u00a0Stone Cold spent his nights beating up his boss, chugging beer, and serving up Stone Cold Stunners to anyone that dared step into the ring with him. And he did it all while sporting the iconic goatee.\u00a0The sports world took notice,\u00a0and the decade was dominated by athletes putting their best face forward, one that often featured a finely maintained outline of hair starting just below the nose and ending on the chin.\u00a0In honor of \"The Rattlesnake\",\u00a0in no particular order,\u00a0here are the top nine athlete\u00a0goatees of the 90s.\u00a0Owen NolanThere is a silly rumor out there that Owen Nolan was born with a goatee. This could not be further from the truth. In reality, Owen Nolan's goatee came first\u00a0and he grew up around it.\u00a0Gary PaytonGary Payton's goatee took no mess. An infamous trash-talker, The Glove's manicured mouth-curtain served to give a frame of reference to opposing guards as to where the stream of expletives being thrown at them was coming from.\u00a0Mike PiazzaThe greatest hitting catcher of his generation, Piazza perplexed pitchers with a seemingly\u00a0impossibly well-maintained goatee. Over the course of 16\u00a0years he ran the gamut of upper-lip maintenance, but never looked as much at home as he did with a classic New York goatee.\u00a0Jeff BagwellJeff Bagwell had a lovely 15-year career, with 449 home runs and a .297/.408/.540 line, making a fun debate about whether or not he deserves to be in the Baseball Hall of Fame. What can't be debated is that Bagwell was a goatee connoisseur, seeming to draw his power from the ugliness hanging off his chin.\u00a0Tupac ShakurOkay, technically Pac wasn't an athlete, he did star as Birdie, a local thug in the movie Above The Rim. It would be shortsighted to not include Tupac in any list honoring the most influential figures on the 90s, and equally shortsighted to minimize the role his Van Dyke played in sculpting the faces of future generations.Scott Stevens\u00a0New Jersey Devils defenceman Scott Stevens was, above all else, absolutely terrifying. Known for delivering borderline murderous body checks, Stevens marched to his own drum. When\u00a0others\u00a0grew playoff beards, he sported the playoff goatee. Seeing Stevens\u00a0with a goatee meant one thing: it was time to keep your head up.\u00a0Karl Malone6-foot-9 and 250 pounds, the Mailman's goatee was there to outline an immovable scowl. Though Malone would often play around with the thin moustache and full beard look, he never looked so comfortable and angry as he\u00a0did with a bold full goatee.Alexi LalasWhen the USA hosted the 1994 World Cup\u00a0a nation was introduced to soccer. The conduit for the beautiful game was the\u00a0hideous facial hair of American defender Alexi Lalas. \"This is what soccer is,\" Lalas' goatee seemed to exclaim. \"Trust me, you'll love it in 20 years.\"Mark McGwireMark McGwire thrust himself into the hearts and minds of the general public in 1998 with the great home run race against Sammy Sosa. Sporting a goatee that looked like a carbon of the one on Patron Saint Stone Cold, McGwire closed out the decade strongly reinforcing that the 90s unequivocally belonged to the goatee. theScore.com Advertisement Related Articles Pranksters who posed as strongman duo on morning news show being sued Pranksters who posed as strongman duo on morning news show being sued Top News 9h ago Stephen A.

Soul Patches The soul patch is, arguably, the most illogical of all 90's trends. The chin strap beard, while stupid, clearly said, \"I do too have a chin. I outlined it in my face hair. See?\" The goatee wordlessly declared, \"I'm an assh*le!\" So what did a soul patch say? \"The only thing I follow more religiously than minor league baseball is trends involving confused displays of masculinity.\" If you ever had a soul patch, please take a moment to stew in your shame. If you still have a soul patch, you've got a little barbecue sauce in there. 2. JNCOs Perhaps it was because of all of the Skip-It related chafing wounds, or just a general fondness for the feel of perpetually filthy shreds of fabric flopping against your calves, but, in the 90's, nothing was cooler than going to Kohl's with your mom to buy a fly new pair of JNCOs. WAS, being the operative word. We can all agree now that the circumference of your \"pipes\" should not exceed the length of your inseam. It just looks stupid. It doesn't matter how many yo-yo's you had stashed in there; no one needs that much room in their pants. 3. Leather Pants No one who was over the age of 11 at any point in the 90's made it through the decade without wondering, \"Could I pull off leather pants?\" The answer, ubiquitously, was, \"No,\" but Ricky Martin, Crazy Spice, and the actresses on Charmed were unrelenting in their desire to make leather pants last. In the end, the insane dry cleaning bills and the fact that you can't take anyone in leather pants seriously defeated this terrible trend. Just in case: no. You can't pull off leather pants. Don't try to bring them back. No. 4. Thug Looney Tunes Shirts Nothing proves the collective idiocy of the 90's more than the fact that a group of businessmen thought, \"People will probably buy T-shirts with Looney Tunes characters dressed in 'urban' attire,\" and then people actually bought them. This fad predated the safety mechanism of ironic fashion. If you wore an oversized T-shirt with a picture of Bugs Bunny wearing baggy, backwards jeans, you genuinely thought it was cool. At some point in the 90's, at least one person was probably held at gun point by someone in a gangster Tasmanian Devil T-shirt. Just think about that and vow to never let this fashion trend return. 5. Backwards Jeans Why was Bugs Bunny dressed in backwards jeans? Oh yeah. Because that was a thing people did. Specifically \"Mac Daddy\" and \"Daddy Mac\" of the hip-hop group Kris Kross. They are to blame for countless misplaced beepers and chaos at junior high urinals. This is the kind of trend that can only be discussed by using the phrase \"youth culture\" in the most crotchety tone of distanced disparagement, but, come on, you tried your jeans on backwards. Just don't try it again. Page 1 of 5Next Filed Under: soul patch90sLists Comments We like you. Do you like us too? Don't ask me again.

(Picture:\u00a0Getty Images) A lot of WTF things happened in the 90s \u2013 neon, bad hair and double denim to name a few. Some are hard to explain even now. 1. Big fish, little fish, cardboard box (and other such dances) Face it, it was a terrible dance and its\u00a0origins in the 90s dance scene mutated into the joke dance your uncles do when trying to look young. Then Bob the Builder covered the song. \u00a0WTF? (Picture: Flickr/Scott.Symonds) 2. Overplucked Eyebrows The 90s started so well for eyebrows, they were full and natural and then something terrible happened that caused the majority of women to pull the hairs out of the brows till they were barely there lines of WTF. \u00a0And most have never recovered. #drewbarrymore always! #90s #icon #idol #fashion #makeup #beautiful #instalike #instapic #picoftheday #potd #blogger #like #love #followme A post shared by nicholajane (@nicholajanexo) on Sep 6, 2015 at 11:54am PDT 3. Backwards jeans Kriss Kross may make you jump jump, but the backwards jeans trend was a big no no. 4. CK1 Pour Homme et Femme\u2026 Everyone smelt the same in the 90s, and it was overly sweet, sickly and unisex. 5. Alcopops An unethical blend of child friendly flavours with strong booze was a trend that started in the 90s and led to mass hysteria from parents and high levels of drunkness in teens. 6. Tamagotchis So you had a pet on a keyring that you fed and cared for. \u00a0For a week and then it died and you were too embarrassed to admit you weren\u2019t even responsible enough to care for a digital animal. \u00a0But they seemed SO high tech at the time! (Picture: Getty) 7. Scrunchies, snoods, bows and fabric headbands The 90s were teaming with women wearing too much fabric on their heads. \u00a0And even worse, it occasionally matched their clothes. \u00a0As if the weird, massive hair wasn\u2019t bad enough. (Picture: Flickr/montroyaler) 8. Talk to the hand And all those other Americanisms that infiltrated UK culture in the 90s. \u2018Well DUHHH!\u2019 \u2018NOT!\u2019 \u2018Take a chill pill\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s my name, don\u2019t wear it out!\u2019 When we only had four TV channels there was none of this, but the introduction of satellite TV meant these phrases became commonplace in Western-Super-Mare and Rotherham. (Picture: Flickr/Vernon Chen) 9. CatDog A cartoon where a cat and a dog were joined together in a mutated and bizarre way. WTF? Infancia. #catdog #nickelodeon A post shared by Joel Liz\u00e1rraga. (@joel_lizarraga_) on Sep 6, 2015 at 11:36pm PDT 10. The Goatee If 2015 is the year of the beard, then the 90s were the decade of the goatee. \u00a0Be warned current beard owners, in years to come we will probably be looking back at your facial hair with the same scorn as we do of goatees. (Picture: Getty) The 90s had a lot of great things and as trends come around we are starting to see some popping back up in style. But there are some we hope stay firmly in the past.

If you are planning on getting your 90\u2019s on hair-wise, that is, this is the place for you. We start with the ubiquitous Rachel do which you couldn\u2019t get away from (and, really, who would want to \u2013 it was so damn cute). But, we don\u2019t stop there.\u00a0 We explore the ins and outs of 90s facial hair fashions and more.\u00a0 Read on. Let us know what kind of hair you had in the 90s (and better yet, send pics!) by posting it on our \t\t\t90s 411 Facebook page. The burning questions need answers \u2013 like, who had better hair: George Clooney or Dawson? The Rachel | 90\u2019s Hairstyles for Women (non-Rachel) | 90\u2019s Hairstyles for Men | The Caesar | 90s Facial Hair Continue Reading Below The Rachel \"So I want it kind of rough and ready but like really shiny and smooth and kind of chin length but shoulder lengthy and like straight but a bit curly and a sort of golden brown but a bit blonde. Wait a minute let me get my People Magazine out!\" That was the conversation held in thousands of hair salons in the mid-90s as women everywhere tried to describe the \"Rachel Cut\" named after and inspired by the character played by Jennifer Aniston in the sitcom Friends which was then at the peak of its popularity. This definitive 90\u2019s hairstyle was a shoulder-length, sleek and layered style with a grown out fringe and highlights mainly around the face. It was the most popular hair fashion fad of the 90\u2019s and the envy of all women. It also inspired many a \"just got out of bed\" hair product, for example one of the originals Tigi Bed Head. > back to top 90s Hairstyles for Women (non-Rachel) I, having dark brown hair which refuses to get anywhere closer to blonde than a hideous bleached Cheshire Cat orange, never really had the full benefit of the Rachel Do or the absolute flood of beach blonde hair that was in fashion but 90\u2019s fashion had a hairstyle for everyone and I went through a few. I started with the short Demi Moore in Ghost do, moved on to the short, choppy Meg Ryan style then swiftly onto the Winona Ryder in Mermaids bob and the heavy Terri Hatcher Louis and Clark shiny bob before finally smoothing and thinning out for a Posh Spice bob in the late 90\u2019s. I unfortunately never had hair long enough for the super straight straggled Grunge look or the wavy Julia Roberts look and wasn\u2019t going to touch the Demi Moore GI Jane skinhead look with a very long stick. For an overview in 1990\u2019s hairstyles, we recommend a reviewing of uber-popular 90\u2019s TV shows such as Beverly Hills 90210 and Melrose Place. > back to top 90\u2019s Hairstyles for Men Boys had their own trends to follow. For the daring fashion crowd there were hair styles with zig zags and Nike ticks shaved into them and inspired by Hip Hop artists and big bleached hair inspired, not by the previous decade\u2019s Wham but by the \"pretty fly for a white guy\" MC Hammer wannabe Vanilla Ice. Will the real Slim Shady please stand up? For the everyday boy on the street the look was floppy and dreamy like Dawson of Dawson\u2019s Creek, Joey of Friends, Edward Furlong pre voice breaking in Terminator 2 and Keanu Reeves of\u2026. well practically every 90s movie going! This was the look for anyone wanting to attract a girlfriend rather than make a nineties fashion statement. The kind of hair that made you just ache to lean over and gently move it out of their adorable eyes just before they told you they loved you, gave you a slow sloppy kiss and recited a bit of poetry! > back to top The Caesar Finally, let us not forget the ubiquitous, ultra-short Caesar style which looked just gorgeous on the more mature man such as George Clooney in ER and Russell Crowe in Gladiator but unfortunately made anyone under the age of thirty look like they were going to steal your purse and mug your neighbors. > back to top 90s Facial Hair Since it involved hair and was on the head generally, we are including an analysis of men\u2019s facial hair trends in the 1990\u2019s as well. The Goatee One look for men which was executed with style by some and in the worst way possible by others was the goatee. This devilish style swept through the male chin world of the 1990s and, despite making people look a little like the devil, can still be seen on many chins today. The goatee was equally at home on the band member of a Grunge band (90\u2019s icon Kurt Cobain) as it was on the lead singer of a Jazz Funk band (remember Jamiroquai and the Godzilla music video?). It was named the goatee because of it\u2019s similarity to a Billy goat beard and was the perfect way to wear a beard without looking like your dad. For successful attempts at goatees then check out 1990\u2019s Brad Pitt or Johnny Depp. Or, as I mentioned previously \u2013 the Devil. For less coveted versions think Colonel Sanders, Lenin or my high school friend Dan who, after his failed attempt at growing a goatee, was never again called \"Dan\" in his high school career. Due to the unfortunate coarse curly hair which made up his goatee he was forever more called \"Pubic Hair Chin!\" Long Side Burns Another popular hair trend for men in the 90\u2019s was the long, thick sideburn. Perhaps this burn lengthening was wrapped up in the 70s revival in the fashion world. Whatever the impetus, burns got longer and thicker and were (I\u2019ll admit it) a weakness of mine. Think Chris Isaak in the very sexy \tWicked Game era or Jason Priestly of 90210. In case you are interested, Dan (my goatee-growing friend from high school) eventually got rid of the goatee. But, I haven\u2019t learned my lesson yet and still have a twice yearly disastrous attempt at going classic 90\u2019s \tBaywatch blonde.

Maybe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not releasing any new material so watching them now promises to be only marginally more exciting than checking in with Kurt Cobain. \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0Or maybe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because their return was so unexpected, it's left me reeling with uncertainty.\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, what else from the 90's will return? Here are five fearless predictions: Advertisement 1. Lilith Fair Back in the mid 90\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bunch of ladies saw the success of Lollapalooza and decided to show the world that sisters could do it for themselves.\u00c2\u00a0 Soon a group of somewhat talented artists banded together united only by their one hit wonder status and lack of a penis.\u00c2\u00a0 Shawn Colvin, Meredith Brooks, Paula Cole, and others.\u00c2\u00a0 (I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d include Sarah McLachlan, but she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s had more than one hit and that would ruin my wild generalization.\u00c2\u00a0 Also, she never replied after I wrote that letter about kissing her so hard, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just going to assume she actually does have \u00c2\u00a0a penis.) Well in 2010, Lillith Fair will return with a vengeance.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 And not with Lady Gaga and Ke$ha flying the grrl-power banner. \u00c2\u00a0No, instead, our old friends will take to the stage with new anthems like Brooks\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a Bitch (Just Like This Menopause);\u00c2\u00a0 Colvin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cSonny Never Visits Anymore;\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 and Paula Cole\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cPiss Off Gladstone, I Had Two Hits.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The feisty music-loving college girls of the 90s will now be able to purchase tickets at Starbucks, Talbots, and, of course, Gymboree. 2. Bad Sex I hesitate to go here because after the Lillith Fair cracks I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d hate to be misunderstood as a misogynist.\u00c2\u00a0 But being misunderstood is what writing for the internet is all about.\u00c2\u00a0 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like a big game of \u00e2\u0080\u009cTelephone\u00e2\u0080\u009d that you play only with your deaf friends.\u00c2\u00a0 Who are also neurologically impaired. \u00c2\u00a0So here goes.\u00c2\u00a0 I know it may come as a surprise to you 21st century boys and girls, but women were different in the 90\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\u00c2\u00a0 This was before Sex and the City feminism took hold. Today, women hold onto the false delusion that they can empower themselves by tweeting \u00c2\u00a0frankly about how much they enjoy \u00c2\u00a0oral sex.\u00c2\u00a0 Where a frattish mentality of getting drunk and laid is somehow akin to saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a woman and I will not be denied !\u00e2\u0080\u009d Now, of course that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wrong-headed and false, but men don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t typically try to dispel that notion because, well why would we dissuade you from talking about oral sex?\u00c2\u00a0 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s much easier for dudes to say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re an independent woman. Now finish your beer and do that thing I like with the thing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But back in the 90\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, it was a different scene.\u00c2\u00a0 Intelligent, sexual women across the land (or at least at my University) wanted to run with the wolves while reading Naomi Wolfe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Beauty Myth.\u00c2\u00a0 They couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t put on make up or shave their legs without asking, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy am I doing this; are these the tools of my oppression; and how does Gladstone get so dreamy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the stats to prove this, but in the 90\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fewer asses got spanked during sex then any decade in modern history.\u00c2\u00a0 The 69 rose in prominence as the only accepted egalitarian form of oral sex. And for the first time in history, a frank dialogue about the magic and glory of the menses was considered foreplay. Well, get ready, because in 2010, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all coming back.\u00c2 \u2193 Continue Reading Below Sex and the City 2 will hit theaters and suddenly women will react in horror at the lifeless shell Carrie Bradshaw has become.\u00c2\u00a0 Soon Ani DiFranco records will start to sell again and French maid outfits will be returned in record numbers.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Your free ride is over fellas. Time to grow a pony tail and get some Indigo Girls records. 3. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThanks for Sharing\u00e2\u0080\u009d/\u00e2\u0080\u009dToo Much Information\u00e2\u0080\u009d Historians tell us that for a brief six week period in the fall of 1991, it was actually considered somewhat witty and/or clever to say \u00e2\u0080\u009cthanks for sharing\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009ctoo much information\u00e2\u0080\u009d when confronted with unwanted details from another\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal life.\u00c2\u00a0 We may never know why humor was ascribed to these phrases, but all our best data tells us it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true.\u00c2\u00a0 Indeed, even today, there are still clusters of humorless conversation trolls who feel empowered by using \u00c2\u00a0these phrases as if they were magical incantations, instantly transforming \u00c2\u00a0the speaker into a person more important than the addressee.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 They have no idea that every self-respecting human stopped saying this shortly before the start of the Clinton administration. Well they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in luck.\u00c2\u00a0 In 2010, a void will form in our language and welcome the unfortunate return of these phrases.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0Why?\u00c2\u00a0 Because in 2010 \u00e2\u0080\u009cFail\u00e2\u0080\u009d will finally leave the vernacular.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 (Incidentally, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmeh\u00e2\u0080\u009d will hold tight for another five years.) Soon, millions of the worst people in the world will be unsure what to say when being exposed to unexpected, unwanted information.\u00c2\u00a0 And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s when the TMI jargon returns. Some of you may be doubting this prediction.\u00c2\u00a0 How does it make sense to reply \u00e2\u0080\u009cthanks for sharing\u00e2\u0080\u009d to a youtube video you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t approve of? \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0Well , in truth, it makes no sense.\u00c2\u00a0 But then again, it was never really logical to say \u00e2\u0080\u009ctoo much information\u00e2\u0080\u009d to your co-worker when he was trying to open up to you about the death of his mother either. 4. Goatees Did you misread that? Not Goatse. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a 21st century creation.\u00c2\u00a0 No, I said \u00e2\u0080\u009cgoatee\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that tiny beard circling one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mouth that --much like Goatse-- \u00c2\u00a0actually does conjure thoughts of a-holes.\u00c2\u00a0 But in the 90\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it was part of the standard uniform.\u00c2\u00a0 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to believe, but just over a decade ago, this incomplete facial hair formation, could actually increase a guy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chances of having sex \u00e2\u0080\u0093 especially when coupled with long hair.\u00c2\u00a0 It was a look that said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey world, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a beard. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not clean-shaven either.\u00c2\u00a0 You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t define me with your boring rules. \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00c2\u00a0 And seriously what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sexier than that? In 2010, the goatee comes back stronger than ever. Why? Because of this column.\u00c2\u00a0 The power of the internet, baby.\u00c2\u00a0 Tomorrow morning, every guy who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s read this will stare in his bathroom mirror overcome by a certain sensation.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood lord, Gladstone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s onto something!\u00c2\u00a0 What if the ladies couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see the skin immediately around my mouth?\u00c2\u00a0 What if it appeared from the proper distance that I had a cinnamon donut stuck to my face?\u00c2\u00a0 Good lord, how much tail would that get me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 You may doubt it now, but it's already in play.\u00c2\u00a0 You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re already on your way. Congratulations, sexy! In fact, I just started a facebook group called \u00e2\u0080\u009cGoatees for 2010\u00e2\u0080\u009d to get this baby going.\u00c2\u00a0 If the group gets, over 100 members with pics posted, I promise to post too. (I understand it will take a few days to get the facial hair in place).\u00c2\u00a0 I will also do my best to get the other Cracked columnists to do so \u00e2\u0080\u0093 understanding, of course that Daniel O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Brien and Michael Swaim may lack the testerone-based fortitude to achieve such things. 5. Full House Hey remember one of the worst sitcoms ever? No? Why? Because you were 5? Oh.\u00c2\u00a0 Well what about syndication? Yes, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m talking about Full House. That show about a Jewish guy who was somehow named Tanner and not actually Jewish who had to raise two baby troll dolls after his wife died. Thinking fast, he recruits John Stamos and Dave Coulier to help out.\u00c2\u00a0 The show ran from 1987 to 1995 and I imagine it sucked the entire length of that time, but truth be told, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure I ever saw a full episode. In any event, in 2010, Full House returns.\u00c2\u00a0 Not a remake.\u00c2\u00a0 All the same actors return in modern day.\u00c2\u00a0 The make-shift family will reunite to help the Olson twins deal with their eating disorders.\u00c2\u00a0 Bob Saget, once known for being funny and one of the dirtiest stand ups prior to Full House, will now drop F bombs non stop.\u00c2\u00a0 And Dave Coulier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s catch phrase will be \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey, y\u00e2\u0080\u0099know Alanis Morrissette was totally talking about going down on me in that theater.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe me?\u00c2\u00a0 Doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sound right for TV? What if I told you the cast did the whole show in black face and it was called Tyler Perry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Full House of Payne?\u00c2\u00a0 Yep. Believe it.\u00c2\u00a0 Enjoy your 2010, guys.

                            "text": "Here Are the Most Popular Beard Styles Over the Past 16 Decades Beards seem to be having a moment.But really, they've been having one for years.The rise of the \"Postmillennial He-Man Beard Epoch\" has been with us for some time, with one\u00a0New York Times writer pegging it to around 2007, when he\u00a0noticed\u00a0his middle-aged beard seemed suddenly trendy with the younger men around him. Fast forward a few years\u00a0and the\u00a0\"lumbersexual\" revolution\u00a0hit hard, with beards paired with plaid shirts for a \"Ron Swanson mixed with Ryan Gosling\" look. Now, gone are the plaid shirts \u2014 2015 is about the\u00a0beard-and-man-bun combo.The recent facial hair enthusiasm might give the impression young men have just discovered beards. But facial hair isn't a modern novelty \u2014\u00a0there's always the question of how to shape what we've got. Trends cycle in and out, as any photo of a\u00a0Civil War general\u00a0will remind you. The latter half of the 1800s was a beard bonanza, while in the 1920s, beards became rarer and rarer (thanks, in no small part, to the introduction of\u00a0commercialized shaving razors\u00a0by Gillette).\u00a0By the 1950s, the number of men with beards was at an\u00a0all-time low, only to be revived by hippie culture in the late 1960s and 1970s. By then, businessmen were\u00a0growing beards\u00a0\u2014 as evidenced by the\u00a0facial hair evolution\u00a0on\u00a0Mad Men \u2014\u00a0only to morph into those regrettable goatees of the late '90s-early aughts.Check out the photos to see how far our faces have come.Beards had a serious \"moment\" from the 1850s to 1880s.The early 1850s was a time of restrained elegance and style; by the 1880s, beards were everywhere. A beard signaled masculinity and health, and there were endless varieties. Some beards precariously off the bottom of men's faces, while some came with mustaches (something Gen.\u00a0Ulysses S. Grant and\u00a0Gen.\u00a0Stonewall Jackson could both agree upon).\u00a0By the 1920s and 1930s, old men owned the bearded look.Think about it: Gatsby didn't have a beard. In the 1920s and 1930s, beards were no longer counted among trendy facial hair. By the looks of archival photos, mostly men of a certain age wore beards.In the 1940 and '50s, facial hair was rare. Unless, of course, you had a goatee.\u00a0Facial hair was still a pretty uncommon during that time, but the goatee made its way into popular culture by way of counterculture movements like the beatniks and influential jazz musicians in the '40s (including Dizzy\u00a0Gillespie, one of the only men who made a soul patch look good).By the 1960s, beards were a symbol of creativity and rebelliousness.A clean-shaven look was still popular in the early 1960s (again, see the early seasons of Mad Men). There were, however, some beard trends, like the goatee and scruffy beard. But judging by archival photos, they were worn mostly by creative types like writers, filmmakers and revolutionaries like Che Guevara. Definitely not a style for the office.With the rise of hippie culture and disco in the '70s, full beards made a comeback.In the 1970s facial hair and men's grooming were more varied than before. Hairstyling wasn't just for women and men generally embraced a more hairy look overall. The influence of bands like the Beatles and Bee Gees also can't be ignored. Overgrown beards were in style but mustaches reigned supreme.The rise of '90s alternative bands brought with it goatees and soul patches.Men embraced a clean-shaven look in the decade after the '70s, thanks in part to the rise of corporate culture and political conservatism. There were certainly the occasional and iconic mustaches\u00a0(think: Tom Selleck in Magnum P.I.) but a full-on beard wasn't in style\u00a0in the workplace, forcing many to adopt baby smooth skin.That all began changing in the early '90s when popular alternative bands became more mainstream. Musicians in bands like Nirvana, Anthrax and Everclear wore a range of facial hairstyles ranging from the soul patch to dyed beards.\u00a0In the early 2000s, things got a little scruffy and patchy.After the soul patch of the '90s, a hybrid of the goatee and scruffy beard look became more popular. Celebrities like Keanu Reeves, Matt LeBlanc and Colin Farrell grew beards that evoked a nonchalant attitude. The extra-shaggy goatee remained popular also\u00a0thanks in part\u00a0to stars like Brad Pitt and Johnny Depp.Thankfully, we've achieved bearded perfection: the man bun-and-beard combo.* praise hands *",

Subject: Goatees in the 90s Written By: Ryan112390 on 05/19/12 at 8:32 pm It seems sometime around the late 80s/90s goatees became (and seem to remain) the \"in\" sort of facial hair look...From the 1920s-1950s, it was the pencil mustache, in the 1960s it was any style of facial hair, the 70s and 80s were dominated by mustaches of all kinds and sideburns...But it seems sometime around the end of the 80s or the beginning of the 1990s, goatees began to be really popular, starting their popularity amongst guys who were in their 20s in the early 1990s. Can anyone remember when in the 80s/90s they became popular, and what popularized them? Like for those who can remember the 80s and 90s, around what year did you first start seeing guys with goatees in real life and in film/tv, or start seeing other guys convert their beards or moustaches into goatees? Subject: Re: Goatees in the 90s Written By: Rafael on 05/19/12 at 9:11 pm the goatees became popular in circa 1994 because when i see sports videos from the the early 1990s several players still had moustaches and then in the mid 1990s nobody had one.

Even in the heat of the summer, the hairy trend continues to prevail. Still, if you think that\u2019s crazy, you probably missed the \u201990s. From about 1990-1998, some very weird facial hairstyles dominated the music world. There were a lot of incomplete goatees and quite a few runaway beards. Don\u2019t believe us? Check out some of the craziest and most \u201990s facial hair below\u2013 but we\u2019re warning you, you can never un-see what you\u2019re about to witness. 1 The Floating Goatee Getty Images A goatee is just a small patch of hair located on the chin. Seemingly simple, yet in the \u201990s, a lot of musicians literally missed the mark. John Dolmayan style was the perfect example of this nonchalant look, he had a soul patch just above his chin, so it wasn\u2019t quite a goatee, but it can\u2019t be disregarded all together. Hence, a new category is born: \u201cthe floater.\u201d 2 The Chin Mane Getty Images This exaggerated style still lives on today\u2013 ahem, Brad Pitt\u2013 but it was all the rage for rockers back in the day. Anthrax\u2019s lead guitarist Scott Ian not only sported this look, but he often dyed his mane. We\u2019re guessing to match his mood. 3 The Braided Beard Getty Images Shavo Odadjian clearly takes the cake when it comes to braided beards. The man had facial hair longer than the hair on most people\u2019s head. It wasn\u2019t a good luck, but it was very \u201990s. 4 The Landing Strip @artalexakis This style is pretty self-explanatory. It\u2019s a thin strip of hair that starts under the lip and ends wherever it wants. Please look to Art Alexakis for reference. The dad of three still rocks his classic style although no one else has since 1998. 5 Animal Style Sideburns Getty Images Sideburns alone aren\u2019t a \u201990s trend, but grooming those bad boys to your jawline? That\u2019s something that most men avoid these days. Back in his Limp Bizkit prime, Wes Borland sported some of the creepiest sideburns we\u2019ve ever seen. (Seriously, if his appearance in the \u201cNookie\u201d video doesn\u2019t haunt you, we don\u2019t know what will.) 6 The Hourglass Conundrum Getty Images Fred Durst rocked this style loud and proud in the \u201990s. His thin and oddly shaped beard closely resembled an hourglass. 7 The Dot Getty Images This style is similar to the \u201cfloating goatee\u201d with considerably less effort. As the name suggests, it is a literal dash of hair under your lip. Not very logical, but it was a trend all the same. 8 The 3-piece Masterpiece: A Combination Style [image src=\"wp-attachment://46414\"] Although this style combines three already horrible looks on the list, it has to stand on it\u2019s own for all of the musicians who rocked this exact look. Late Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain wore it best. Not only did Kurt\u2019s mustache connect to his beard, but he took it a step further by having a thin, two-part goatee that wasn\u2019t connected to anything.

Bryan Curtis on the beard for all seasons. Plus, a gallery of A-list whiskers. Bryan Curtis 11.12.09 6:13 PM ET Breaking: Brad Pitt has a full-blown goatee. It\u2019s long and gray and bushy, and when Pitt showed it off last week at a movie premiere, it was beaded in a style favored by the pirates of the Caribbean. If there were ever a time to reassess the state of facial hair, this would seem to be it. It used to be that growing a goatee was some kind of fashion statement. Now the goatee has become the Gap T-shirt of beards. The New New Goatee can be worn at home or at the office, by the hip and unhip alike, signifying, well, just about anything. Click Image to View Our Gallery of Goatees The New New Goatee is a beard for all seasons, as harmless as a tattoo. This becomes apparent by reviewing a list of Americans who have been sporting goatees lately: Kobe Bryant, Tim McGraw, Pastor Rick Warren, chef Rick Bayless, NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd, Todd Palin, Larry the Cable Guy, even Mariah Carey in her latest music video. \u201cThere is no kinship at all,\u201d Chuck Todd, who is a good sport for answering his phone, tells me. Larry the Cable Guy does not concur: \u201cI think Brad Pitt might have the goatee just because I pulled it off so good,\u201d he says. What does a New New Goatee mean? First you have to understand that the goatee has always been hard to pin down. Shakespeare had one, as did the Flemish painter Anthony van Dyck, whom the Van Dyke was named after. (For simplicity\u2019s sake, I have grouped the Van Dyke and the goatee together, even though the Van Dyke is the official name for the lip-chin combo.) \u201cImagery often shows Pan or the Devil with a goatee,\u201d says Allan Peterkin, the author of One Thousand Beards: A Cultural History of Facial Hair. In the 20th century, the goatee was alluring enough to attract Lenin and Buffalo Bill, Burl Ives and Dizzy Gillespie, Colonel Sanders and Malcolm X, Dobie Gillis\u2019 Maynard G. Krebs and Spike Lee, Anthrax\u2019s Scott Ian and Kurt Cobain. It was Cobain and his grunge mates who resurrected the goatee from its Beat obsolescence in the 1990s. Though the goatee retains little of their residue of cool\u2014if you\u2019re at the cutting edge of facial hair, you\u2019re wearing a full Zach Galifianakis\u2014it is oddly more prominent in mainstream American life than ever. The New New Goatee sometimes symbolizes brainy gravitas. This is most notable in Chuck Todd, NBC\u2019s chief White House correspondent. Todd\u2019s ginger goatee, which he grew in the summer of 2002, is a bracing counterpoint to clean-shaven mugs like Brian Williams\u2019. \u201cIt highlights that nobody on TV has facial hair,\u201d Todd says. But those carefully trimmed whiskers are part of Todd\u2019s magic. A veteran of the D.C. insider tip sheet The Hotline, Todd is NBC\u2019s numbers guy, its Election Day stats guru. In the blowhard universe of TV news, Todd\u2019s pronouncements seem to carry real weight\u2014you actually believe he knows what he\u2019s talking about. Todd\u2019s goatee confers upon him the same kind of authority as a political-science professor\u2019s goatee. Last month, when Todd lost a public bet with ABC News correspondent Jake Tapper and appeared poised to shave off the goatee, blogger Dan Amira compared it to Samson\u2019s locks. Todd made a $2,000 donation to charity and kept the goatee by a whisker. Another take on the New New Goatee: It is a symbol of bloggy, stay-at-home cred. \u201cI wish I were part of some grand sociological trend,\u201d says Jonah Goldberg, the goateed conservative pundit and frequent blogger on National Review Online. \u201cBut I mostly do it because I work from home and it makes it easier to go very long periods of time without shaving.\u201d The New New Goatee can signify both youth and maturity. Billy Joel\u2019s goatee is a sign of an older man trying to recapture his youth. Michael Phelps\u2019 goatee is a sign of a golden boy trying to look older. There are, of course, aesthetic considerations. \u201cFirst and foremost, they\u2019re thinning,\u201d says Larry the Cable Guy. When he debuted as a morning radio personality in the 1990s, Larry\u2019s act was delightfully offensive but his face was baby-smooth. \u201cI looked like a kid, a punk, no facial hair, nothing,\u201d he says. Larry grew a full beard, but that was a smidge too country\u2014\u201cI looked like an Oak Ridge Boy\u201d\u2014so he pruned it down into a goatee. Paired with a baseball cap and sleeveless shirt, these days Larry looks like he has just exited a Golden Corral buffet. He has redneck gravitas. Don\u2019t like your New New Goatee? Simply change an accessory or two. Add some pricey eyewear, and a goatee can make you hip, as it does Johnny Depp. Doff your shirt, and it can make you all-powerful, as it does Shane Carwin of the Ultimate Fighting Championship. Stand in the vicinity of a Republican presidential candidate, and a goatee can make you look like the campaign\u2019s sage, as with McCain aide Mark Salter. A goatee can lend an otherwise unremarkable creature a touch of menace. Google News turns up dozens of criminal suspects like this one from Oregon over the weekend: \u201ca white male about 5 feet 9 inches or 6 feet tall and weighing between 160 and 180 pounds. He may have a goatee.\u201d Ooga-boogah! How did we end up with all this chin foliage? On the one hand, the New New Goatee is the case of something hip becoming something mainstream. It is also the case of the American office becoming a more casual place; Allan Peterkin notes that about the only people who can\u2019t have goatees nowadays are politicians and bankers. The New New Goatee is also a sign of our neo-Bohemia, where formal culture has mixed with hipster culture and created a mix of the two: the Wall Street trader who wears a goatee with his Michael Kors suit. Pitt reportedly grew his goatee for his role in The Lost City of Z, a real-life Victorian adventure. But what you make of the facial growth depends on what you make of Pitt. Some cast it as a youthful star finally confronting middle age (\u201cMeet Joe Grey,\u201d quipped The Daily Mail). Others have suggested he grew it just because he knew he would still look great. When Pitt attempted an earlier version of the look in January, there was at least one howl of outrage from a female fan at the Golden Globes, who was apparently convinced Pitt was hiding his magnificent face.

First create the shape with a beard trimmer. A general guide is a straight line down from the corner of your mouth. It's your call if you want to connect it to your mustache or not. Shave the lower border line at the bottom of your chin bone. Then set it in stone with a wet shave. Cheeks and neck will need to be shaved on a daily basis to stop the goatee from looking like a peculiarly shaped beard. Both Brad Pitt and Idris Elba keep the goatee from looking too throwback by balancing it out with a mustache and wearing the hair relatively short \u2013 mowed every few days with the lower half of the guards on a beard trimmer.

Eyebrows were drawn on with Sharpies, highlights were streaky, and everything had glitter in it. We tied a flannel around our waist and traveled down the nostalgia rabbit hole to find the best of the worst.By Meirav DevashApril 30, 2015Photos: Getty Imagesfacebook dialogPinterestEmailfacebook dialogPinterestSkinny BrowsIn the '90s, only Brooke Shields was allowed to have full eyebrows. Everyone else was required by law to tweeze away almost everything and then draw it back in with a superthin line. Our brave ancestors relied on their friends to survive the brow drought. Former BFFs Courtney Love and Drew Barrymore may not have had very much eyebrow left here, but they had each other.facebook dialogPinterestSkinny BrowsGwen Stefani, the embodiment of a decade, took her penciled brows one step beyond by placing a jeweled bindi between them, then adding crystals along the bottom lash line that made it look like she was crying.facebook dialogPinterestSkinny BrowsYou know what really highlights a pair of pencil-thin brows? Charlize Theron's platinum crop and tiny adolescent-style bangs.facebook dialogPinterestSkinny BrowsWe're as surprised as Pamela Anderson's eyebrows are that she dated Bret Michaels in 1994\u2014we totally repressed that memory.facebook dialogPinterestThe Fountain HeadBefore Ariana Grande and the ponytail conspiracy theories she inspired (it's a wig; she's covering a third eye in the back of her head; it's where her antennae are hidden), wearing a high ponytail fountain jutting out of the crown of your head was kind of common. Janet \"Miss Jackson If You're Nasty\" Jackson did it with long braids and a turban.facebook dialogPinterestThe Fountain HeadBritney Spears MacGyvered a white scrunchie out of...a Hanes T-shirt? A cloth diaper? Your guess is as good as ours.facebook dialogPinterestThe Fountain HeadPaula Abdul reached heights Ariana Grande could only dream of with a simple black hair wrap.facebook dialogPinterestThe Fountain HeadDanielle Fishel gave us a honey-brown hair waterfall to chase after (even though TLC warned us not to).facebook dialogPinterestWhy Tendrils? Why?Every rose had its thorn, and every updo had its tendrils. The idea was noble\u2014updos look stiff, so why not pull out some face-framing pieces to soften the look? Layering wasn't the art it is now, so the strands tended to just dangle there uselessly, slightly obstructing your vision. Julia Stiles wore the popular windshield-wiper version in 10 Things I Hate About You.facebook dialogPinterestWhy Tendrils? Why?Kate Moss glammed it up on the runway and almost pulled it off. She is Kate Moss, after all.facebook dialogPinterestWhy Tendrils? Why?Melissa Joan Hart turned one big tendril into a sagging sausage curl. Very prom-chic.facebook dialogPinterestWhy Tendrils? Why?Claire Danes worked her weird tendrils with a bob and some tiny butterfly clips.facebook dialogPinterestWhy Tendrils? Why?Jennifer Aniston went full Medusa with tendrils on tendrils and a Claire's Accessories store's worth of tiny hair clips.facebook dialogPinterestPorcupine UpdosAnother way to make your updo more exciting was to make sure the ends of your hair were spiky instead of tucking them in with bobby pins. This way, they poked out in all directions and confused the eye. Claire Danes got a young Leonardo DiCaprio's attention with these broomlike bristles.facebook dialogPinterestPorcupine UpdosCourteney Cox's sprouts were the more relaxed version.facebook dialogPinterestPorcupine UpdosAlicia Silverstone combined spikes with tendrils and butterfly clips for a '90s-trend trifecta.facebook dialogPinterestBlue Eye-Shadow OverloadThe thing about wearing '90s blue eye shadow is that basically any amount is too much. (Need we remind you of the Mimi Bobeck character on The Drew Carey Show?) Here, baby Reese Witherspoon looks like she got into her mom's makeup bag and went to town.facebook dialogPinterestBlue Eye-Shadow OverloadJennifer Lopez brought her frosty blue shadow all the way up to the brow.facebook dialogPinterestBlue Eye-Shadow OverloadBack in her dark, edgy days, Angelina Jolie went for the clown-paint approach: pale skin, high arches, and a creepy Joker smile.facebook dialogPinterestSo Much Body GlitterDuring this weird blip in time, decorating yourself with glitter powders, gels, and sprays was acceptable\u2014even encouraged. And no one thought this made them look like a stripper. Britney Spears liberally applied body glitter to her d\u00e9collet\u00e9 and shoulders, creating a vaguely sweaty effect.facebook dialogPinterestCrunchy HairBefore co-washing and sulfate awareness, most hair products had the same alcohol content as Everclear. Texture was really important, whether you rocked braids, waves, or crispy curls. (Touchability, not so much.) Cameron Diaz hit the crimping iron hard for this Top Ramen hair look.facebook dialogPinterestCrunchy HairChristina Aguilera fluffed her egg-noodle curls up and out and set them with shellac.facebook dialogPinterestCrunchy HairLook at Kirsten Dunst! Her shiny zigzags are crisp and hot off the crimper.facebook dialogPinterestCrunchy HairOne way to get crimps without hot tools was to put your hair in braids before going to sleep. Looks like Kate Moss was about to do just that (after putting out her cigarette).facebook dialogPinterestCrazy Accent BraidsCoachella, shmoachella. The '90s had its own brand of boho hair, and it didn't involve wearing an oversize floral crown. Randomly placed braids were one way to signify that you were laid-back, maaaan. Madonna's take was very Sea Hag Chic: center-parted, disheveled beach waves with ropy braids.facebook dialogPinterestCrazy Accent BraidsScarlett Johansson's hair wraps were like wearing friendship bracelets in your hair.facebook dialogPinterestCrazy Accent BraidsFiona Apple decided to wear all the hair textures\u2014straight, frizzy, curly, and braided\u2014for a raised-by-wolves vibe.facebook dialogPinterestCulturally Insensitive CornrowsWe all went to the Bahamas in 1994 and collectively had the same terrible idea. Let's just pretend this never happened, OK, Juliette Lewis?facebook dialogPinterestCulturally Insensitive CornrowsYou too, Melissa Joan Hart.facebook dialogPinterestBrown LipstickNot red, not pink, but grungy brown lips were the thing. (There were so many lipsticks named after cocoa and raisins.) Women were drawn to the color because it was dark and moody, but not as try-hard as a vampy berry or goth burgundy. Mostly, it looked...muddy. T-Boz, Left-Eye, and Chilli of TLC all took time away from stapling condoms to their clothes to swipe it on.facebook dialogPinterestBrown LipstickJulianne Moore looked like she was colored in with an auburn crayon\u2014her hair, eyebrows, smoky eye shadow, and lipstick were somehow all the same shade.facebook dialogPinterestBrown LipstickJennifer Lopez gave her lips a coat of glossy wood varnish.facebook dialogPinterestBrown LipstickDrew Barrymore went totally matte. A gray-blue undertone in the color helped simulate hypothermia.facebook dialogPinterestBrown LipstickAnd then there was that frosted nude-mauve color that wasn't brown but definitely didn't look nude. It seems like Tori Spelling, Shannen Doherty, and Jennie Garth all shared the same tube of lipstick at this party, and it's the most '90s thing we've ever seen.facebook dialogPinterestTwo BarrettesCourtney Love, riot grrrls, and double-dutch jumpers had already called dibs on plastic barrettes. Then Jennifer Lopez really classed up the idea of doing your hair like an eight-year-old by adding diamonds.facebook dialogPinterestTwo BarrettesSalma Hayek wore double barrettes to a Giorgio Armani fashion show, but she looked like she was already rethinking it.facebook dialogPinterestMini BunsIt's around this time that women started wondering if wearing one bun was enough. Maybe the more, the better? Bj\u00f6rk started the trend, and everyone was charmed because she's an adorable little Icelandic pixie who wears way weirder stuff all the time.facebook dialogPinterestMini BunsGwen Stefani wore them, too, and everyone was already used to her half-shirt and bindi, so they let it slide.facebook dialogPinterestMini BunsBy the time Reese Witherspoon used baby buns to spice up her mom bob, the tide had already turned.facebook dialogPinterestMini BunsSorry, Heather Graham.facebook dialogPinterestChunky HighlightsEveryone got highlights in the '90s, and they wanted to make sure you knew it. Lightened sections were big, bright, and super-obvious. Gwyneth Paltrow and Brad Pitt were unforgettable in their his-and-hers zebra stripes.facebook dialogPinterestChunky HighlightsGeri Halliwell of the Spice Girls bleached just the front. The two-tone look was what she wanted, what she really, really wanted.facebook dialogPinterestChunky HighlightsJennie Garth applied her highlights with a paint roller.facebook dialogPinterestChunky HighlightsCourteney Cox tried it with darker colors in wine and brown. Still weird.facebook dialogPinterestEverything Is Wrong HereBehold, A.J. Langer from My So-Called Life, who wore every '90s beauty trend at the same time.

Mandatory // Play Today\u2019s MLB Sluggers With \u201990s Style Goatees Don't be afraid of the chin hair, fellas. by Gary Dudak Aug 19th, 2015 The \u201990s were a great time for the long ball, when Major League Baseball players regularly hit 50+ home runs and defied traditional power numbers. It was also a great time for the goatee, with sluggers like Mark McGwire, Jeff Bagwell, Ken Caminiti and Larry Walker regularly sporting them. This carried into the early 2000s with guys like Albert Pujols, but it seems to be lost on most of today\u2019s best hitters. That\u2019s a damn shame, too, because obviously they would look way more badass, as you can clearly see below.

Soul Patches The soul patch is, arguably, the most illogical of all 90's trends. The chin strap beard, while stupid, clearly said, \"I do too have a chin. I outlined it in my face hair. See?\" The goatee wordlessly declared, \"I'm an assh*le!\" So what did a soul patch say? \"The only thing I follow more religiously than minor league baseball is trends involving confused displays of masculinity.\" If you ever had a soul patch, please take a moment to stew in your shame. If you still have a soul patch, you've got a little barbecue sauce in there. 2. JNCOs Perhaps it was because of all of the Skip-It related chafing wounds, or just a general fondness for the feel of perpetually filthy shreds of fabric flopping against your calves, but, in the 90's, nothing was cooler than going to Kohl's with your mom to buy a fly new pair of JNCOs. WAS, being the operative word. We can all agree now that the circumference of your \"pipes\" should not exceed the length of your inseam. It just looks stupid. It doesn't matter how many yo-yo's you had stashed in there; no one needs that much room in their pants. 3. Leather Pants No one who was over the age of 11 at any point in the 90's made it through the decade without wondering, \"Could I pull off leather pants?\" The answer, ubiquitously, was, \"No,\" but Ricky Martin, Crazy Spice, and the actresses on Charmed were unrelenting in their desire to make leather pants last. In the end, the insane dry cleaning bills and the fact that you can't take anyone in leather pants seriously defeated this terrible trend. Just in case: no. You can't pull off leather pants. Don't try to bring them back. No. 4. Thug Looney Tunes Shirts Nothing proves the collective idiocy of the 90's more than the fact that a group of businessmen thought, \"People will probably buy T-shirts with Looney Tunes characters dressed in 'urban' attire,\" and then people actually bought them. This fad predated the safety mechanism of ironic fashion. If you wore an oversized T-shirt with a picture of Bugs Bunny wearing baggy, backwards jeans, you genuinely thought it was cool. At some point in the 90's, at least one person was probably held at gun point by someone in a gangster Tasmanian Devil T-shirt. Just think about that and vow to never let this fashion trend return. 5. Backwards Jeans Why was Bugs Bunny dressed in backwards jeans? Oh yeah. Because that was a thing people did. Specifically \"Mac Daddy\" and \"Daddy Mac\" of the hip-hop group Kris Kross. They are to blame for countless misplaced beepers and chaos at junior high urinals. This is the kind of trend that can only be discussed by using the phrase \"youth culture\" in the most crotchety tone of distanced disparagement, but, come on, you tried your jeans on backwards. Just don't try it again. Page 1 of 5Next Filed Under: soul patch90sLists Comments We like you. Do you like us too? Don't ask me again.

Even in the heat of the summer, the hairy trend continues to prevail. Still, if you think that\u2019s crazy, you probably missed the \u201990s. From about 1990-1998, some very weird facial hairstyles dominated the music world. There were a lot of incomplete goatees and quite a few runaway beards. Don\u2019t believe us? Check out some of the craziest and most \u201990s facial hair below\u2013 but we\u2019re warning you, you can never un-see what you\u2019re about to witness. 1 The Floating Goatee Getty Images A goatee is just a small patch of hair located on the chin. Seemingly simple, yet in the \u201990s, a lot of musicians literally missed the mark. John Dolmayan style was the perfect example of this nonchalant look, he had a soul patch just above his chin, so it wasn\u2019t quite a goatee, but it can\u2019t be disregarded all together. Hence, a new category is born: \u201cthe floater.\u201d 2 The Chin Mane Getty Images This exaggerated style still lives on today\u2013 ahem, Brad Pitt\u2013 but it was all the rage for rockers back in the day. Anthrax\u2019s lead guitarist Scott Ian not only sported this look, but he often dyed his mane. We\u2019re guessing to match his mood. 3 The Braided Beard Getty Images Shavo Odadjian clearly takes the cake when it comes to braided beards. The man had facial hair longer than the hair on most people\u2019s head. It wasn\u2019t a good luck, but it was very \u201990s. 4 The Landing Strip @artalexakis This style is pretty self-explanatory. It\u2019s a thin strip of hair that starts under the lip and ends wherever it wants. Please look to Art Alexakis for reference. The dad of three still rocks his classic style although no one else has since 1998. 5 Animal Style Sideburns Getty Images Sideburns alone aren\u2019t a \u201990s trend, but grooming those bad boys to your jawline? That\u2019s something that most men avoid these days. Back in his Limp Bizkit prime, Wes Borland sported some of the creepiest sideburns we\u2019ve ever seen. (Seriously, if his appearance in the \u201cNookie\u201d video doesn\u2019t haunt you, we don\u2019t know what will.) 6 The Hourglass Conundrum Getty Images Fred Durst rocked this style loud and proud in the \u201990s. His thin and oddly shaped beard closely resembled an hourglass. 7 The Dot Getty Images This style is similar to the \u201cfloating goatee\u201d with considerably less effort. As the name suggests, it is a literal dash of hair under your lip. Not very logical, but it was a trend all the same. 8 The 3-piece Masterpiece: A Combination Style [image src=\"wp-attachment://46414\"] Although this style combines three already horrible looks on the list, it has to stand on it\u2019s own for all of the musicians who rocked this exact look. Late Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain wore it best. Not only did Kurt\u2019s mustache connect to his beard, but he took it a step further by having a thin, two-part goatee that wasn\u2019t connected to anything.

Take The Longpigs for example, who tasted success with a couple of hits, though it was when everyone took their eye off the ball that Crispin Hunt produced his \u201899 chef d\u2019oeuvre, \u2018Mobile Home\u2019. No one bought it but that didn\u2019t make it any less brilliant. Image credit: Getty Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 2 of 50 Marion Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus Marion: In the mid-90s Macclesfield\u2019s Marion made lots of new friends touring with Radiohead, and their album \u2018This World and Body\u2019 was a classic for sensitive bedroom-dwelling eyelinered types with an aversion to sunlight. \u2018Sleep\u2019 made a top 20 splash, then singer Jaime Harding was arrested selling stolen garden gnomes for crack and things went downhill from there on in. Image credit: Press Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 3 of 50 Strangelove Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus Strangelove: Bristol\u2019s Strangelove were led by the wonderfully peculiar Patrick Duff, and they somehow channelled the spirit of glam rock and the darkness of Joy Division at the same time. Brett Anderson attempted to sprinkle stardust unto them when he recorded backing vocals on their \u2018Love and Other Demons\u2019 album, but the rest of the world wasn\u2019t quite ready and they dissolved in 1998. Image credit: Getty Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 4 of 50 My Life Story Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus My Life Story: Jack Shillingford apparently assembled his mini indie orchestra by stopping people on the London underground carrying musical instruments under their arms during the early 90s. The Marc Almond-inspired \u201812 Reasons Why I Love Her\u2019 was the first of a string of minor hits in the mid-90s and was quietly tremendous to boot. Image credit: Press Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 5 of 50 Babybird Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus Babybird: Everyone remembers \u2018You\u2019re Gorgeous\u2019, a sarcastic ode to the objectification of woman by sleazy photographers that would become the albatross around mainman Stephen Jones\u2019 neck. Jones had wildly prolific periods right up to 2012 when Babybird quit, but nothing ever came close to that success. Top tip to wedding DJs: \u2018You\u2019re Gorgeous\u2019 still fills a floor with dancing uncles. Image credit: Getty Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 6 of 50 Campag Velocet Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus Campag Velocet: Towards the end of the 90\u2019s Pete Voss\u2019 Portsmouth prowlers were unlikely NME cover stars, imbuing the menace of A Clockwork Orange had Alex\u2019s droogs developed an unhealthy fetish for cycling gear. These figureheads of Skunk Rock divided opinion, confused indie rock fans, though ultimately they remained a niche concern peaking at no.75 in the charts with \u2018Vito Satan\u2019. Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 7 of 50 Electronic Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus Electronic: Electronic was formed by two quintessential pillars of indie rock, but in the hubbub of all their other revered work of legend, it\u2019s easy to forget all about what Sumner and Marr did together for a few years in the 90s. \u2018Get The Message\u2019 was understated yet still somehow astonishing, and \u2018Getting Away With It\u2019 had Neil Tennant on it! A supergroup worth remembering then\u2026 Image credit: Getty Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 8 of 50 These Animal Men Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus These Animal Men: Brighton\u2019s These Animal Men had it all; the swagger, the cool threads, the major label deal and the rock star behaviour. The only thing they didn\u2019t really have was any hits. Arriving in a hailstorm of hype and riding the coattails of the New Wave of New Wave, they rattled on the top 75\u2019s door a few times before staggering off to bed. Image credit: Getty Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 9 of 50 Terris Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus Terris: Newport\u2019s much-hyped and woefully unsuccessful Terris are one of those bands whose activity straddles two millennia, though having formed in \u201898 and having broken up again in \u201802, that\u2019s about as interesting as it gets for this lot. NME loved them but the people voted with their feet and went to see Craig David instead. Some you win, some you lose\u2026 Image credit: Getty Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 10 of 50 King Adora Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus King Adora: King Adora were another band who emerged at the end of the millennium, proving to be the most exciting thing to come out of Birmingham since the pneumatic tyre, peaking shortly after the millenium with the glammy, booze-fuelled \u2018Vibrate You\u2019. Image credit: Getty Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 11 of 50 Mansun Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus Mansun: Mansun were much-loved by a barmy few in the mid-90s, and back when record companies had more money than sense, they memorably chucked away \u00a325,000 at Liverpool Street Station to promote single \u2018Taxloss\u2019. Imagine the boilersuits you could buy with that now. Their remaining rabid fans still hold out hope for reformation, but singer Paul Draper says \u2018no\u2019 about once every Tuesday. Image credit: Getty Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 12 of 50 Geneva Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus Geneva: Nude Records boss Saul Galpern certainly struck lucky when he signed Suede, though his other notable signings from the mid-90s \u2013 Geneva \u2013 didn\u2019t quite set the world alight in the same way. They did muster a few hits though, and those who heard angel-voiced East Kilbride-born singer Andrew Montgomery will not forget the experience in a hurry. Because it was lovely, that\u2019s why. Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 13 of 50 Kingmaker Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus Kingmaker: Early \u201990s Hull trio Kingmaker were feted by the music press for a while, but soon seemed like the naffest thing in the world soon after their moment in the sun. Image credit: Getty Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 14 of 50 Wheatus Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus Wheatus: Good god, it\u2019s Wheatus! They had a massive hit with \u2018Teenage Dirtbag\u2019 this lot, and if you don\u2019t like it then you should be ashamed; I mean come on, how can you hate a song that mentions Iron Maiden in the chorus? They also did a pretty great version of Erasure\u2019s \u2018A Little Respect\u2019, so you know, a little respect eh? Not too much though. Image credit: Getty Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 15 of 50 The Gin Blossoms Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus The Gin Blossoms: Named after the boozy condition rosacea (a reddening of the skin that sometimes becomes a bulbous red nose), this thirsty alternative rock band from Arizona had a massive radio hit with \u2018Hey Jealousy\u2019 in 1993. Unfortunately the writer of their winsome signature tune \u2013 guitarist Doug Hopkins \u2013 killed himself whilst being treated for alcoholism that same year. Image credit: Getty Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 16 of 50 Blind Melon Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus Blind Melon: Blind Melon had a really, really, really big hit in 1993 called \u2018No Rain\u2019 which is particularly memorable thanks to the Bee Girl in the video. They had some other songs that were quite good that no one remembers on account of the fact those songs didn\u2019t have videos featuring a Bee Girl. Image credit: Getty Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 17 of 50 Ultrasound Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus Ultrasound: Ultrasound were a late 90s indie band from Yorkshire who had a singer who looked a bit like Johnny Vegas who went by the name of Tiny. After one album and a falling out they dissolved in 1999, but last year they came back with a magnificent album called \u2018Play For Today\u2019, a record you\u2019ve almost certainly not checked out and one you would be foolish not to. Think on. Image credit: Getty Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 18 of 50 Salad Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus Salad: In the early 90s, Marianne Van Der Vlugt had a successful career as a VJ on MTV Europe, but was that enough for her? No it wasn\u2019t. The Dutch former model clearly thought she could do better and so formed Salad with some other musicians. Their debut album \u2018Drink Me\u2019 made no.16 in the UK charts. Image credit: Getty Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 19 of 50 Gay Dad Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus Gay Dad: Gay Dad were figures of both derision and suspicion in the late \u201890s, and most of it came from the fact founding member Cliff Jones used to write for Melody Maker and The Face. The poacher-turned-gamekeeper\u2019s \u2018To Earth With Love\u2019 was fine, the fairly execrable \u2018Joy!\u2019 ended up on a car ad. And that was about that. Image credit: Getty Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 20 of 50 The Wildhearts Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus The Wildhearts: He might have been know as David Leslie Walls to his mum, but to the rest of us he is Ginger. Since their inception at the end of the 80s, The Wildhearts have split up and reformed again no less than five times \u2013 whenever they split up they somehow end up rocking together again. Image credit: Getty Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 21 of 50 Curve Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus Curve: Back in the dark ages (ie the early 90s), Toni Halliday of Curve probably got more attention for her pulchritude than for her considerable talent in the music press, but she was a hero and an inspiration to many and without her the likes of Garbage and The Kills would sound very different indeed. Put on, say, \u2018Fait Accompli\u2019, and you\u2019ll see what we mean. Image credit: Getty Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 22 of 50 Regular Fries Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus Regular Fries: Baggy rose again in the late-90s under what some in the music press were calling Skunk Rock \u2013 a genre derived from the supposed penchant of its purveyors to smoke a bit of skunk. The drug, not the animal. Regular Fries made a psychedelic melange of big beats and searing guitar wig outs, and captivated their groovy north London fanbase until their premature conclusion in 2001. Image credit: Press Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 23 of 50 Rialto Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus Rialto: Louis Eliot of Rialto was so posh he made George Osborne look like Ozzy Osbourne \u2013 his surname comes from the Port Eliot family of the famous Cornish literary festival. It caused much suspicion among record buyers (who were a really suspicious lot in the 90s). Rialto\u2019s big hit \u2018Untouchable\u2019 was a thrilling indie romp which borrowed liberally from Wham!\u2019s \u2018Last Christmas.\u2019 Image credit: Press Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 24 of 50 David Devant and his Spirit Wife Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus David Devant and his Spirit Wife: Named after a 19th century magician, this band were led by The Vessel, the supposed conduit of the titular Victorian Paul Daniels. The Vessel was prone to shaving carrots on his head when playing live, as you do. The band still play now and again; go show some love to these undervalued stalwarts. Image credit: Getty Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 25 of 50 Crash Test Dummies Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus Crash Test Dummies: Altogether now in an impossibly deep voice: \u201cOnce there was this kid who\u2026\u201d This peculiar Manitoban five-piece had a massive hit in the UK with \u2018Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm\u2019 in the early 90\u2019s, thanks to some disproportionate patronage from Radio 1\u2019s Simon Mayo. A kind of mania swept the land and the slightly haunting tune landed at No.2. The rest of their stuff? Mmmm. Hmmmm\u2026 Image credit: Getty Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 26 of 50 Ugly Kid Joe Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus Ugly Kid Joe: It\u2019s odd to think these dumbass Californian surfer rock dudes reached double platinum status in the early 90s thanks to their MTV-approved monster smash \u2018Everything About You\u2019. The song was sort of like a love song, but wherever you\u2019d expect the word \u2018love\u2019, they changed it to \u2018hate\u2019. They then had another big hit with a Cat Stevens number before slipping into obscurity. Image credit: Getty Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 27 of 50 Scarfo Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus Scarfo: If you\u2019ve ever looked at Jamie Hince and thought \u2018Christ, he looks old, maybe he\u2019s just had a hard life,\u2019 the truth of the matter is he is actually quite old. Before the Kills he had an indie band called Scarfo and they did some quite nice tunes. Don\u2019t feel sorry for him, he\u2019s married to Kate Moss. Image credit: Press Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 28 of 50 Porno for Pyros Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus Porno for Pyros: Jane\u2019s Addiction are a band that have split up and got back together again even more times than The Wildhearts, Madness and The Libertines all rolled into one. During one sabbatical, Perry Farrell even took seriously the prospect of having another band for a while, hence Porno for Pyros. Their best song was \u2018Pets\u2019, though everyone thinks it\u2019s Jane\u2019s Addiction anyway. Image credit: Getty Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 29 of 50 Idlewild Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus Idlewild: Idlewild were a fantastic Scottish indie band who saw shapes and had a brilliantly monikered singer called Roddy Woomble. At some point they got rid of their ace drunken bass player Bob, headed off in a new bland REM b-sides direction and everyone yawned and forgot about them. Apparently they\u2019re back again, though Bob remains consigned to the dustbin of history. Shame.

Image credit: Press Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 31 of 50 Babylon Zoo Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus Babylon Zoo: Jas Mann (not to be confused with Killing Joke\u2019s Jaz Coleman) must have exploded with joy when \u2018Spaceman\u2019 was chosen for the new Levis advert in 1995. The problem was, the bit chosen for the advert \u2013 the cool intro bit \u2013 was great, the song itself that proceeded afterwards was a bit of a drudge.

Everyone surely remembers \u2018What\u2019s Up\u2019. Since she broke the band up in \u201895, she\u2019s worked with Courtney Love, Gwen Stefani, Sugababes and most famously Christina Aguilera. She also recently married Darlene from Roseanne (actress Sara Gilbert)!

Their biggest hit \u2013 \u2018Gepetto\u2019 \u2013 was about the famous wooden toymaker who is currently being investigated by Operation Yewtree.

In fact Radcliffe rinsed this unknown quantity on his radio show and \u2018Your Woman\u2019 ended up at no.1. Jyoti Prakash never really did trouble the charts again, though some of his other stuff was quite good too.

It did well on its release, and then was used in the movie version of The Saint, doing even better on its re-release. Chris later relocated to Berlin and formed IAMX.

Veruca Salt burst out of Chicago during the early 90\u2019s and because they were noisy and featured girls they were lazily categorised as Riot Grrrl by many, though they weren\u2019t. Not really.

He actually formed Shack with his brother in 1986, though much of the acclaim and the \u201clost genius\u201d tag were bestowed in the late 90s. Shack even signed to Noel Gallagher\u2019s Sour Mash label alongside those other notorious non starters, Proud Mary.

Okay, so this multi-platinum selling band are hardly forgotten, but perhaps they\u2019re a little unfairly derided, no? Image credit: Getty Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 40 of 50 The Auteurs Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus The Auteurs: Luke Haines brought his acerbic songs to the Britpop party. An almost even bigger upset nearly occurred when the Auteurs narrowly missed out to Suede for the 1993 Mercury Prize. Haines says he\u2019ll never reform the Auteurs, a pity given none of his records (except maybe Baader Meinhof) have come close to the diabolical brilliance of the band\u2019s four underrated albums.

Singer Skin was still pinching herself on the night, and to be honest, none of us could believe it either. Time travel may not really exist, but put \u2018Hedonism\u2019 on this second and I swear to Christ you\u2019ll be transported back to the mid-90s in an instant.

Altogether now, \u201cshe\u2019s in the corner, giving the orders.\u201d Image credit: Press Click or tap to zoom into this image This is image 43 of 50 3 Colours Red Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Googleplus 3 Colours Red: Although named after the Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski arthouse film of the same name, there was nothing highfalutin about these hard drinking, hard rocking miscreants (they apparently stuck a pin in Time Out when choosing their name). Signed to Alan McGee\u2019s Creation in the latter half of the 90s, the Chris McCormack-led bruisers cracked the top 20 of the UK album charts twice.

Singer Nick Sanderson played in late period Jesus and Mary Chain, and when he tragically died from lung cancer aged 47, the Reid brothers put their differences aside to play together at his funeral.

The Carmarthen warriors may not have worried the charts too much, but their five years together is now spoken about in reverent, hushed whispers having taken folk to somewhere spiky, interesting and delightful.

The Wannadies appeared on the soundtrack of the Baz Luhrmann version, and how we swooned at \u2018The You and Me Song\u2019. Such a glorious tune, and yet does anyone remember anything else they ever did? Do the band even remember?

Furter? Amen also featured Slayer\u2019s former drummer Dave Lombardo for a while, and how could you not rock with Dave Lombardo in the band? Answer: Amen did rock. Amen to that.

NME cover stars with much expected of them, they criminally only released one album \u2013 A Life With Brian \u2013 and split a few years later due to a lack of productivity. Sadly singer Liam Maher died of a heroin overdose in 2009.

Their debut 1999 EP \u2013 \u2018Mathematics\u2019 \u2013 is a lost classic, although not in France and Italy, where the group were rightfully cherished.

It all really depends where you picked up the trail, but the hairy Austin rockers and wanton destroyers of drumkits (sometimes two drum kits) actually formed in 1994. They\u2019re still going and their ninth album \u2013 cleverly titled \u2018IX\u2019 \u2013 is out later this year.

Maybe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not releasing any new material so watching them now promises to be only marginally more exciting than checking in with Kurt Cobain. \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0Or maybe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because their return was so unexpected, it's left me reeling with uncertainty.\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, what else from the 90's will return? Here are five fearless predictions: Advertisement 1. Lilith Fair Back in the mid 90\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bunch of ladies saw the success of Lollapalooza and decided to show the world that sisters could do it for themselves.\u00c2\u00a0 Soon a group of somewhat talented artists banded together united only by their one hit wonder status and lack of a penis.\u00c2\u00a0 Shawn Colvin, Meredith Brooks, Paula Cole, and others.\u00c2\u00a0 (I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d include Sarah McLachlan, but she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s had more than one hit and that would ruin my wild generalization.\u00c2\u00a0 Also, she never replied after I wrote that letter about kissing her so hard, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just going to assume she actually does have \u00c2\u00a0a penis.) Well in 2010, Lillith Fair will return with a vengeance.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 And not with Lady Gaga and Ke$ha flying the grrl-power banner. \u00c2\u00a0No, instead, our old friends will take to the stage with new anthems like Brooks\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a Bitch (Just Like This Menopause);\u00c2\u00a0 Colvin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cSonny Never Visits Anymore;\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 and Paula Cole\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cPiss Off Gladstone, I Had Two Hits.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The feisty music-loving college girls of the 90s will now be able to purchase tickets at Starbucks, Talbots, and, of course, Gymboree. 2. Bad Sex I hesitate to go here because after the Lillith Fair cracks I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d hate to be misunderstood as a misogynist.\u00c2\u00a0 But being misunderstood is what writing for the internet is all about.\u00c2\u00a0 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like a big game of \u00e2\u0080\u009cTelephone\u00e2\u0080\u009d that you play only with your deaf friends.\u00c2\u00a0 Who are also neurologically impaired. \u00c2\u00a0So here goes.\u00c2\u00a0 I know it may come as a surprise to you 21st century boys and girls, but women were different in the 90\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\u00c2\u00a0 This was before Sex and the City feminism took hold. Today, women hold onto the false delusion that they can empower themselves by tweeting \u00c2\u00a0frankly about how much they enjoy \u00c2\u00a0oral sex.\u00c2\u00a0 Where a frattish mentality of getting drunk and laid is somehow akin to saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a woman and I will not be denied !\u00e2\u0080\u009d Now, of course that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wrong-headed and false, but men don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t typically try to dispel that notion because, well why would we dissuade you from talking about oral sex?\u00c2\u00a0 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s much easier for dudes to say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re an independent woman. Now finish your beer and do that thing I like with the thing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But back in the 90\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, it was a different scene.\u00c2\u00a0 Intelligent, sexual women across the land (or at least at my University) wanted to run with the wolves while reading Naomi Wolfe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Beauty Myth.\u00c2\u00a0 They couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t put on make up or shave their legs without asking, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy am I doing this; are these the tools of my oppression; and how does Gladstone get so dreamy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the stats to prove this, but in the 90\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fewer asses got spanked during sex then any decade in modern history.\u00c2\u00a0 The 69 rose in prominence as the only accepted egalitarian form of oral sex. And for the first time in history, a frank dialogue about the magic and glory of the menses was considered foreplay. Well, get ready, because in 2010, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all coming back.\u00c2 \u2193 Continue Reading Below Sex and the City 2 will hit theaters and suddenly women will react in horror at the lifeless shell Carrie Bradshaw has become.\u00c2\u00a0 Soon Ani DiFranco records will start to sell again and French maid outfits will be returned in record numbers.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Your free ride is over fellas. Time to grow a pony tail and get some Indigo Girls records. 3. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThanks for Sharing\u00e2\u0080\u009d/\u00e2\u0080\u009dToo Much Information\u00e2\u0080\u009d Historians tell us that for a brief six week period in the fall of 1991, it was actually considered somewhat witty and/or clever to say \u00e2\u0080\u009cthanks for sharing\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009ctoo much information\u00e2\u0080\u009d when confronted with unwanted details from another\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal life.\u00c2\u00a0 We may never know why humor was ascribed to these phrases, but all our best data tells us it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true.\u00c2\u00a0 Indeed, even today, there are still clusters of humorless conversation trolls who feel empowered by using \u00c2\u00a0these phrases as if they were magical incantations, instantly transforming \u00c2\u00a0the speaker into a person more important than the addressee.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 They have no idea that every self-respecting human stopped saying this shortly before the start of the Clinton administration. Well they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in luck.\u00c2\u00a0 In 2010, a void will form in our language and welcome the unfortunate return of these phrases.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0Why?\u00c2\u00a0 Because in 2010 \u00e2\u0080\u009cFail\u00e2\u0080\u009d will finally leave the vernacular.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 (Incidentally, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmeh\u00e2\u0080\u009d will hold tight for another five years.) Soon, millions of the worst people in the world will be unsure what to say when being exposed to unexpected, unwanted information.\u00c2\u00a0 And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s when the TMI jargon returns. Some of you may be doubting this prediction.\u00c2\u00a0 How does it make sense to reply \u00e2\u0080\u009cthanks for sharing\u00e2\u0080\u009d to a youtube video you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t approve of? \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0Well , in truth, it makes no sense.\u00c2\u00a0 But then again, it was never really logical to say \u00e2\u0080\u009ctoo much information\u00e2\u0080\u009d to your co-worker when he was trying to open up to you about the death of his mother either. 4. Goatees Did you misread that? Not Goatse. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a 21st century creation.\u00c2\u00a0 No, I said \u00e2\u0080\u009cgoatee\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that tiny beard circling one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mouth that --much like Goatse-- \u00c2\u00a0actually does conjure thoughts of a-holes.\u00c2\u00a0 But in the 90\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it was part of the standard uniform.\u00c2\u00a0 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to believe, but just over a decade ago, this incomplete facial hair formation, could actually increase a guy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chances of having sex \u00e2\u0080\u0093 especially when coupled with long hair.\u00c2\u00a0 It was a look that said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey world, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a beard. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not clean-shaven either.\u00c2\u00a0 You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t define me with your boring rules. \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00c2\u00a0 And seriously what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sexier than that? In 2010, the goatee comes back stronger than ever. Why? Because of this column.\u00c2\u00a0 The power of the internet, baby.\u00c2\u00a0 Tomorrow morning, every guy who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s read this will stare in his bathroom mirror overcome by a certain sensation.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood lord, Gladstone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s onto something!\u00c2\u00a0 What if the ladies couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see the skin immediately around my mouth?\u00c2\u00a0 What if it appeared from the proper distance that I had a cinnamon donut stuck to my face?\u00c2\u00a0 Good lord, how much tail would that get me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 You may doubt it now, but it's already in play.\u00c2\u00a0 You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re already on your way. Congratulations, sexy! In fact, I just started a facebook group called \u00e2\u0080\u009cGoatees for 2010\u00e2\u0080\u009d to get this baby going.\u00c2\u00a0 If the group gets, over 100 members with pics posted, I promise to post too. (I understand it will take a few days to get the facial hair in place).\u00c2\u00a0 I will also do my best to get the other Cracked columnists to do so \u00e2\u0080\u0093 understanding, of course that Daniel O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Brien and Michael Swaim may lack the testerone-based fortitude to achieve such things. 5. Full House Hey remember one of the worst sitcoms ever? No? Why? Because you were 5? Oh.\u00c2\u00a0 Well what about syndication? Yes, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m talking about Full House. That show about a Jewish guy who was somehow named Tanner and not actually Jewish who had to raise two baby troll dolls after his wife died. Thinking fast, he recruits John Stamos and Dave Coulier to help out.\u00c2\u00a0 The show ran from 1987 to 1995 and I imagine it sucked the entire length of that time, but truth be told, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure I ever saw a full episode. In any event, in 2010, Full House returns.\u00c2\u00a0 Not a remake.\u00c2\u00a0 All the same actors return in modern day.\u00c2\u00a0 The make-shift family will reunite to help the Olson twins deal with their eating disorders.\u00c2\u00a0 Bob Saget, once known for being funny and one of the dirtiest stand ups prior to Full House, will now drop F bombs non stop.\u00c2\u00a0 And Dave Coulier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s catch phrase will be \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey, y\u00e2\u0080\u0099know Alanis Morrissette was totally talking about going down on me in that theater.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe me?\u00c2\u00a0 Doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sound right for TV? What if I told you the cast did the whole show in black face and it was called Tyler Perry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Full House of Payne?\u00c2\u00a0 Yep. Believe it.\u00c2\u00a0 Enjoy your 2010, guys.

One day he'll write a tell-all book, and then they'll all pay. Until then, you can also catch him at his regular home, The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit, or you can follow him on Twitter. Most unfortunate pop culture trends from the \u201990s are dead and gone, but here are nine that live on like annoying zombies. The good thing about pop culture trends is that most of them, while shitty, go away eventually. But some of them, like that nasty case of herpes you picked up your freshman year in college, never really vanish for good. They either hang around undiluted or just morph into something slightly different. Here are nine such pop culture legacies from a decade that couldn\u2019t end quickly enough if you ask me: the \u201990s. Note for the nitpickers: While some of these things did not necessarily begin in the 1990s, they came to prominence then. So there. The Goatee If you\u2019re reading this and are currently sporting a goatee, do the rest of us a favor and shave that shit off. Right now. What the pornstache was to the \u201970s or the mullet was to the \u201980s, the goatee was to the \u201990s \u2014 a grooming relic best left to those painfully unfunny VH1 retrospective clip shows. The only people who can still get away with that look are actors, athletes, and Evil Spock. So either be a man and commit to the full beard like the rest of us or be done with it. Beanie Babies Now worth DOZENS of dollars. To be fair, Beanie Babies weren\u2019t the first useless item people lost their collective shit over; nor will they be the last. But with most hot toys, the secondary market explodes because the manufacturer can\u2019t keep up with demand. What made Beanie Babies especially annoying (and therefore worthy of this list) was that Ty Inc. artificially kept the supply of individual animals low by \u201cretiring\u201d them. Because God forbid they produce a few thousand more stuffed ducks to prevent a bunch of bored housewives from rioting. This kind of bullshit marketing ploy is now commonplace, to the point where every piece of junk companies pump out is instantly labeled a collector\u2019s item. The absolute nadir of the Beanie Baby craze came in 1996, the first year of the McDonald\u2019s Teenie Beanie Apocalypse. People waited on line for hours and even got into fights, all for the privilege of owning a smaller version of an already useless stuffed toy. But this story does have a happy ending. All those little sacks of stuffing that were treated like gold back then are now no more valuable than most other toys from the era. A recent eBay auction for 65 Teenie Beanies sold for a whopping $23.01. Even that\u2019s a ripoff if you ask me. Adam Sandler Twice as douchetastic. It\u2019s not that I think Adam Sandler lacks talent. He was pretty funny on Saturday Night Live, and I never pass up an opportunity to watch The Wedding Singer on cable. But if there\u2019s an entertainer from the \u201990s who has squeezed more out of his blatantly limited range of ability, I can\u2019t think of one. My brain cannot process the fact that the guy who I first saw as a funny but fairly forgettable bit player on the old Remote Control game show was given money by Hollywood to release a hateful piece of shit like Jack and Jill a few decades later. It\u2019s like his level of success is inversely proportional to how insultingly stupid his projects are. Worst of all, Adam Sandler is the sole reason Rob Schneider isn\u2019t giving handies for meth money in some dank Hollywood alley. I will never forgive him for that. Country Pop I\u2019ll admit that I was never a huge country fan to begin with, but I can at least respect the old school. Johnny Cash, Hank Williams, Willie Nelson, and Waylon Jennings \u2014 this to me is what country music is all about. Not the homogenized, twangy pop pabulum that\u2019s come to represent the genre over the last 20-plus years. Sure, there\u2019s been a huge strain of pop music intertwined with country going all the way back to the days of Countrypolitan in the \u201950s and \u201960s. But Shania Twain, Billy Ray Cyrus, Carrie Underwood, and Taylor Swift? Are you sure Hank done it this way? Multiple Covers Four different covers of X-Men #1. Like a license to print Nerd Bucks. This crap may not have started in the comic book industry, but it sure took hold in a big way there. Publishers realized that they had a hot thing on their hands and, as executives are wont to do, got greedy. Want to move a lot of product but can\u2019t be bothered with writing more stories? Just publish the same damn issue multiple times and slap a different cover on each one. Genius! But it doesn\u2019t stop there, and it hasn\u2019t stopped yet. While a case could possibly be made for wanting multiple comic book covers, I can think of no good excuse for the same from esteemed publications like TV Guide or Cosmopolitan. And yet here we are. Three times as pointless. The Death of Mass Cultural Experiences This one may be a bit of a reach, but work with me. Depending on your viewpoint, the explosion of cable television, the internet, and musical choices in the \u201990s was a double-edged sword. On the one hand, people had more choices than ever before for entertainment. But the downside, as far as I\u2019m concerned anyway, is that the age of the shared cultural experience died for good. Take music as an example, think about it \u2014 what bands have come along since the \u201990s that have effectively taken over our mass consciousness, even if for a little while? I would argue that since Michael Jackson\u2019s heyday, or perhaps even Prince or Bruce Springsteen, you don\u2019t get acts that sell a shit ton of albums and are also impossible to ignore. These days \u2014 and I\u2019m veering dangerously close to Bob Lefsetz territory, admittedly \u2014 the music market is so fragmented that very few top-selling acts actually seep into the brains of non-fans. The same goes for TV. The final episode of M*A*S*H aired in 1983 and drew 125+ million viewers, or seventy-seven percent of all American TV viewers. The only series finale from the last decade to crack the top 10 of that list was for Friends, which drew less than half the viewers and just over half the market share. And I\u2019d wager that more people remember watching the M*A*S*H finale. That\u2019s not to say that we don\u2019t still have extremely popular media. But more and more, the people who enjoy a band or a book or a show are all already fans, and they\u2019re all high-fiving each other in the same little silo. I think the Harry Potter franchise did achieve that breakthrough, so perhaps I\u2019m being premature here. OK, back to the snark. Cash Cow Band Reunions The next time you purchase (or try to) a ticket for a so-called legacy act and then realize that you\u2019d need to sell a few pints of blood just to cover the convenience charge, thank these douchebags: Well at least the two d-bags in the middle. By the time the Eagles hit the road for their Hell Freezes Over tour in 1994, they turned out to be the beneficiaries of a unique convergence between music and demographics. Their core fanbase, the Baby Boomers, were cruising into middle age and their prime earning years, and were more than willing to spend triple figures to relive their youth. Which would be all well and good, but it turned out that Messrs. Henley and friends had little interest in recording new music. In fact it would be 13 years before the reformed band released a proper studio album. In the meantime they went on two more massive, highly lucrative tours. Other bands followed suit in the following years, such as Kiss, the Who, and even the Police. Of course I\u2019m a willing accomplice to an extent, having seen Kiss twice in \u201996 and the Police in 2007, but I can tell you neither was cheap. Collecting As a Business Instead of a Hobby \u201cI\u2019ll go $5 on the Barry Bonds rookie card, but if even one corner is bent I\u2019ll break your legs.\u201d I remember the day I realized that comic books had stopped being fun, and it had nothing to do with finally kissing a girl. I was in one of those permanent flea markets, looking for an old issue of The Avengers\u00a0or Archie or something like that. I walked toward the counter and saw a kid, who couldn\u2019t have been more than 8 or 9 years old, haggling with the store owner over a comic like he was trying to broker a peace deal at Camp David. I put my stuff back, walked out, and never came back. By the 1990s, comic books and sports cards had stopped being pieces of colorful paper for kids and adult fans to accrue and enjoy. They became commodities to be hoarded, speculated on, and dealt like shares of stock or bars of gold. You didn\u2019t dare handle one too much for fear of losing value. This is partly to blame for what turned into the comic book bubble of the early \u201990s. (For more on that, read any of the great and insightful essays by Mile High Comics founder Chuck Rozanski.) Likewise, baseball cards underwent a similar boom period, only to crash in the \u201990s. It\u2019s why cards that you spent a few dozen dollars on then can be had for a fraction of that now on eBay. And while that\u2019s probably as it should be, it just sucks that what was supposed to be a fun hobby turned countless kids into little Gordon Gekkos* in the process. *I\u2019m old and out of touch. Can someone give me a more current reference point for greed than Gordon Gekko? EXTREME (not the band) I get it. Attitude sells. It\u2019s been the case for decades. My main issue with the still-quite-pervasive trend of marketing things as \u201cextreme\u201d is that most of them just aren\u2019t. It\u2019s really just a cynical attempt by corporate executives to dupe people into believing that they have have had instant coolness imbued upon them just by consuming one mass-marketed product over another. Take, for example, one of the prime offenders in the realm of EXTREME marketing \u2014 Mountain Dew. Oh sorry, I meant Mtn. Dew. Here\u2019s one of their decidedly un-extreme \u00a0TV spots from the mid \u201980s. Not very in your face, is it? But add some screaming guitars, extreme cross-training (another fucking term I can\u2019t get enough of), and a de-mulleted tennis star, and you\u2019re ready to ditch those rednecks and DO THE DEW. While Agassi may be gone, the extreme-ness remains. And since the \u201990s it has spread like a damn virus to just about every consumer product imaginable \u2014 from jeans to snack chips to baby carrots. Yes, not even\u00a0baby carrots\u00a0are immune to the X-Games-ification of American culture.
