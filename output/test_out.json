                            "text": "July 24, 2013\nChris Holmes joined the Popdose writing staff only after enduring a humiliating series of hazing rituals. One day he'll write a tell-all book, and then they'll all pay. Until then, you can also catch him at his regular home, The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit , or you can follow him on Twitter .\nMost unfortunate pop culture trends from the \u201990s are dead and gone, but here are nine that live on like annoying zombies.\nThe good thing about pop culture trends is that most of them, while shitty, go away eventually. But some of them, like that nasty case of herpes you picked up your freshman year in college, never really vanish for good. They either hang around undiluted or just morph into something slightly different. Here are nine such pop culture legacies from a decade that couldn\u2019t end quickly enough if you ask me: the \u201990s.\nNote for the nitpickers: While some of these things did not necessarily begin in the 1990s, they came to prominence then. So there.\nThe Goatee\nIf you\u2019re reading this and are currently sporting a goatee, do the rest of us a favor and shave that shit off. Right now. What the pornstache was to the \u201970s or the mullet was to the \u201980s, the goatee was to the \u201990s \u2014 a grooming relic best left to those painfully unfunny VH1 retrospective clip shows. The only people who can still get away with that look are actors, athletes, and Evil Spock. So either be a man and commit to the full beard like the rest of us or be done with it.\nBeanie Babies\nNow worth DOZENS of dollars.\nTo be fair, Beanie Babies weren\u2019t the first useless item people lost their collective shit over; nor will they be the last. But with most hot toys, the secondary market explodes because the manufacturer can\u2019t keep up with demand. What made Beanie Babies especially annoying (and therefore worthy of this list) was that Ty Inc. artificially kept the supply of individual animals low by \u201cretiring\u201d them. Because God forbid they produce a few thousand more stuffed ducks to prevent a bunch of bored housewives from rioting. This kind of bullshit marketing ploy is now commonplace, to the point where every piece of junk companies pump out is instantly labeled a collector\u2019s item.\nThe absolute nadir of the Beanie Baby craze came in 1996, the first year of the McDonald\u2019s Teenie Beanie Apocalypse. People waited on line for hours and even got into fights, all for the privilege of owning a smaller version of an already useless stuffed toy.\nBut this story does have a happy ending. All those little sacks of stuffing that were treated like gold back then are now no more valuable than most other toys from the era. A recent eBay auction for 65 Teenie Beanies sold for a whopping $23.01 . Even that\u2019s a ripoff if you ask me.\nAdam Sandler\nTwice as douchetastic.\nIt\u2019s not that I think Adam Sandler lacks talent. He was pretty funny on Saturday Night Live, and I never pass up an opportunity to watch The Wedding Singer on cable. But if there\u2019s an entertainer from the \u201990s who has squeezed more out of his blatantly limited range of ability, I can\u2019t think of one. My brain cannot process the fact that the guy who I first saw as a funny but fairly forgettable bit player on the old Remote Control game show was given money by Hollywood to release a hateful piece of shit like Jack and Jill a few decades later. It\u2019s like his level of success is inversely proportional to how insultingly stupid his projects are.\nWorst of all, Adam Sandler is the sole reason Rob Schneider isn\u2019t giving handies for meth money in some dank Hollywood alley. I will never forgive him for that.\nCountry Pop\nI\u2019ll admit that I was never a huge country fan to begin with, but I can at least respect the old school. Johnny Cash, Hank Williams, Willie Nelson, and Waylon Jennings \u2014 this to me is what country music is all about. Not the homogenized, twangy pop pabulum that\u2019s come to represent the genre over the last 20-plus years. Sure, there\u2019s been a huge strain of pop music intertwined with country going all the way back to the days of Countrypolitan in the \u201950s and \u201960s. But Shania Twain, Billy Ray Cyrus, Carrie Underwood, and Taylor Swift? Are you sure Hank done it this way?\nMultiple Covers\nFour different covers of X-Men #1. Like a license to print Nerd Bucks.\nThis crap may not have started in the comic book industry, but it sure took hold in a big way there. Publishers realized that they had a hot thing on their hands and, as executives are wont to do, got greedy. Want to move a lot of product but can\u2019t be bothered with writing more stories? Just publish the same damn issue multiple times and slap a different cover on each one. Genius!\nBut it doesn\u2019t stop there, and it hasn\u2019t stopped yet. While a case could possibly be made for wanting multiple comic book covers, I can think of no good excuse for the same from esteemed publications like TV Guide or Cosmopolitan. And yet here we are.\nThree times as pointless.\nThe Death of Mass Cultural Experiences\nThis one may be a bit of a reach, but work with me. Depending on your viewpoint, the explosion of cable television, the internet, and musical choices in the \u201990s was a double-edged sword. On the one hand, people had more choices than ever before for entertainment. But the downside, as far as I\u2019m concerned anyway, is that the age of the shared cultural experience died for good.\nTake music as an example, think about it \u2014 what bands have come along since the \u201990s that have effectively taken over our mass consciousness, even if for a little while? I would argue that since Michael Jackson\u2019s heyday, or perhaps even Prince or Bruce Springsteen, you don\u2019t get acts that sell a shit ton of albums and are also impossible to ignore.\nThese days \u2014 and I\u2019m veering dangerously close to Bob Lefsetz territory, admittedly \u2014 the music market is so fragmented that very few top-selling acts actually seep into the brains of non-fans. The same goes for TV. The final episode of M*A*S*H aired in 1983 and drew 125+ million viewers, or seventy-seven percent of all American TV viewers. The only series finale from the last decade to crack the top 10 of that list was for Friends, which drew less than half the viewers and just over half the market share. And I\u2019d wager that more people remember watching the M*A*S*H finale.\nThat\u2019s not to say that we don\u2019t still have extremely popular media. But more and more, the people who enjoy a band or a book or a show are all already fans, and they\u2019re all high-fiving each other in the same little silo. I think the Harry Potter franchise did achieve that breakthrough, so perhaps I\u2019m being premature here.\nOK, back to the snark.\nCash Cow Band Reunions\nThe next time you purchase (or try to) a ticket for a so-called legacy act and then realize that you\u2019d need to sell a few pints of blood just to cover the convenience charge, thank these douchebags:\nWell at least the two d-bags in the middle.\nBy the time the Eagles hit the road for their Hell Freezes Over tour in 1994, they turned out to be the beneficiaries of a unique convergence between music and demographics. Their core fanbase, the Baby Boomers, were cruising into middle age and their prime earning years, and were more than willing to spend triple figures to relive their youth. Which would be all well and good, but it turned out that Messrs. Henley and friends had little interest in recording new music. In fact it would be 13 years before the reformed band released a proper studio album. In the meantime they went on two more massive, highly lucrative tours.\nOther bands followed suit in the following years, such as Kiss, the Who, and even the Police. Of course I\u2019m a willing accomplice to an extent, having seen Kiss twice in \u201996 and the Police in 2007, but I can tell you neither was cheap.\nCollecting As a Business Instead of a Hobby\n\u201cI\u2019ll go $5 on the Barry Bonds rookie card, but if even one corner is bent I\u2019ll break your legs.\u201d\nI remember the day I realized that comic books had stopped being fun, and it had nothing to do with finally kissing a girl. I was in one of those permanent flea markets, looking for an old issue of The Avengers\u00a0or Archie or something like that. I walked toward the counter and saw a kid, who couldn\u2019t have been more than 8 or 9 years old, haggling with the store owner over a comic like he was trying to broker a peace deal at Camp David. I put my stuff back, walked out, and never came back.\nBy the 1990s, comic books and sports cards had stopped being pieces of colorful paper for kids and adult fans to accrue and enjoy. They became commodities to be hoarded, speculated on, and dealt like shares of stock or bars of gold. You didn\u2019t dare handle one too much for fear of losing value. This is partly to blame for what turned into the comic book bubble of the early \u201990s. (For more on that, read any of the great and insightful essays by Mile High Comics founder Chuck Rozanski.)\nLikewise, baseball cards underwent a similar boom period, only to crash in the \u201990s. It\u2019s why cards that you spent a few dozen dollars on then can be had for a fraction of that now on eBay. And while that\u2019s probably as it should be, it just sucks that what was supposed to be a fun hobby turned countless kids into little Gordon Gekkos* in the process.\n*I\u2019m old and out of touch. Can someone give me a more current reference point for greed than Gordon Gekko?\nEXTREME (not the band)\nI get it. Attitude sells. It\u2019s been the case for decades. My main issue with the still-quite-pervasive trend of marketing things as \u201cextreme\u201d is that most of them just aren\u2019t. It\u2019s really just a cynical attempt by corporate executives to dupe people into believing that they have have had instant coolness imbued upon them just by consuming one mass-marketed product over another.\nTake, for example, one of the prime offenders in the realm of EXTREME marketing \u2014 Mountain Dew . Oh sorry, I meant Mtn. Dew. Here\u2019s one of their decidedly un-extreme \u00a0TV spots from the mid \u201980s.\nNot very in your face, is it? But add some screaming guitars, extreme cross-training (another fucking term I can\u2019t get enough of), and a de-mulleted tennis star, and you\u2019re ready to ditch those rednecks and DO THE DEW.\nWhile Agassi may be gone, the extreme-ness remains. And since the \u201990s it has spread like a damn virus to just about every consumer product imaginable \u2014 from jeans to snack chips to baby carrots. Yes, not even\u00a0 baby carrots \u00a0are immune to the X-Games-ification of American culture.\nSearch for:\n"

A general guide is a straight line down from the corner of your mouth. It's your call if you want to connect it to your mustache or not. Shave the lower border line at the bottom of your chin bone. Then set it in stone with a wet shave. Cheeks and neck will need to be shaved on a daily basis to stop the goatee from looking like a peculiarly shaped beard. Both Brad Pitt and Idris Elba keep the goatee from looking too throwback by balancing it out with a mustache and wearing the hair relatively short \u2013 mowed every few days with the lower half of the guards on a beard trimmer.\nTrending\nRanked on a scale from 1 to 10, the trending score reflects the number of users reading a story in real time.\nWhat is this?\nWant More?\nSign up for our newsletter to get the latest adventures, workouts, destinations, and more.\nWe may use your e-mail address to send you the newsletter and offers that may interest you, on behalf of Men's Journal and its partners.

                            "text": "Toggle navigation\nAdvertisement\n1. Lilith Fair\nBack in the mid 90\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bunch of ladies saw the success of Lollapalooza and decided to show the world that sisters could do it for themselves.\u00c2\u00a0 Soon a group of somewhat talented artists banded together united only by their one hit wonder status and lack of a penis.\u00c2\u00a0 Shawn Colvin, Meredith Brooks, Paula Cole, and others.\u00c2\u00a0 (I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d include Sarah McLachlan, but she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s had more than one hit and that would ruin my wild generalization.\u00c2\u00a0 Also, she never replied after I wrote that letter about kissing her so hard, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just going to assume she actually does have \u00c2\u00a0a penis.) Well in 2010, Lillith Fair will return with a vengeance.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 And not with Lady Gaga and Ke$ha flying the grrl-power banner. \u00c2\u00a0No, instead, our old friends will take to the stage with new anthems like Brooks\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a Bitch (Just Like This Menopause);\u00c2\u00a0 Colvin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cSonny Never Visits Anymore;\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 and Paula Cole\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cPiss Off Gladstone, I Had Two Hits.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The feisty music-loving college girls of the 90s will now be able to purchase tickets at Starbucks, Talbots, and, of course, Gymboree.\n2. Bad Sex\nI hesitate to go here because after the Lillith Fair cracks I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d hate to be misunderstood as a misogynist.\u00c2\u00a0 But being misunderstood is what writing for the internet is all about.\u00c2\u00a0 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like a big game of \u00e2\u0080\u009cTelephone\u00e2\u0080\u009d that you play only with your deaf friends.\u00c2\u00a0 Who are also neurologically impaired. \u00c2\u00a0So here goes.\u00c2\u00a0 I know it may come as a surprise to you 21st century boys and girls, but women were different in the 90\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\u00c2\u00a0 This was before Sex and the City feminism took hold. Today, women hold onto the false delusion that they can empower themselves by tweeting \u00c2\u00a0frankly about how much they enjoy \u00c2\u00a0oral sex.\u00c2\u00a0 Where a frattish mentality of getting drunk and laid is somehow akin to saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a woman and I will not be denied !\u00e2\u0080\u009d Now, of course that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wrong-headed and false, but men don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t typically try to dispel that notion because, well why would we dissuade you from talking about oral sex?\u00c2\u00a0 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s much easier for dudes to say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re an independent woman. Now finish your beer and do that thing I like with the thing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nBut back in the 90\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, it was a different scene.\u00c2\u00a0 Intelligent, sexual women across the land (or at least at my University) wanted to run with the wolve s while reading Naomi Wolfe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Beauty Myth .\u00c2\u00a0 They couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t put on make up or shave their legs without asking, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy am I doing this; are these the tools of my oppression; and how does Gladstone get so dreamy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the stats to prove this, but in the 90\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fewer asses got spanked during sex then any decade in modern history.\u00c2\u00a0 The 69 rose in prominence as the only accepted egalitarian form of oral sex. And for the first time in history, a frank dialogue about the magic and glory of the menses was considered foreplay. Well, get ready, because in 2010, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all coming back.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u2193 Continue Reading Below\nSex and the City 2 will hit theaters and suddenly women will react in horror at the lifeless shell Carrie Bradshaw has become.\u00c2\u00a0 Soon Ani DiFranco records will start to sell again and French maid outfits will be returned in record numbers.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Your free ride is over fellas. Time to grow a pony tail and get some Indigo Girls records.\n3. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThanks for Sharing\u00e2\u0080\u009d/\u00e2\u0080\u009dToo Much Information\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nHistorians tell us that for a brief six week period in the fall of 1991, it was actually considered somewhat witty and/or clever to say \u00e2\u0080\u009cthanks for sharing\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009ctoo much information\u00e2\u0080\u009d when confronted with unwanted details from another\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal life.\u00c2\u00a0 We may never know why humor was ascribed to these phrases, but all our best data tells us it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true.\u00c2\u00a0 Indeed, even today, there are still clusters of humorless conversation trolls who feel empowered by using \u00c2\u00a0these phrases as if they were magical incantations, instantly transforming \u00c2\u00a0the speaker into a person more important than the addressee.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 They have no idea that every self-respecting human stopped saying this shortly before the start of the Clinton administration. Well they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in luck.\u00c2\u00a0 In 2010, a void will form in our language and welcome the unfortunate return of these phrases.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0Why?\u00c2\u00a0 Because in 2010 \u00e2\u0080\u009cFail\u00e2\u0080\u009d will finally leave the vernacular.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 (Incidentally, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmeh\u00e2\u0080\u009d will hold tight for another five years.) Soon, millions of the worst people in the world will be unsure what to say when being exposed to unexpected, unwanted information.\u00c2\u00a0 And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s when the TMI jargon returns. Some of you may be doubting this prediction.\u00c2\u00a0 How does it make sense to reply \u00e2\u0080\u009cthanks for sharing\u00e2\u0080\u009d to a youtube video you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t approve of? \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0Well , in truth, it makes no sense.\u00c2\u00a0 But then again, it was never really logical to say \u00e2\u0080\u009ctoo much information\u00e2\u0080\u009d to your co-worker when he was trying to open up to you about the death of his mother either.\n4. Goatees\nDid you misread that? Not Goatse . That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a 21st century creation.\u00c2\u00a0 No, I said \u00e2\u0080\u009cgoatee\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that tiny beard circling one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mouth that --much like Goatse-- \u00c2\u00a0actually does conjure thoughts of a-holes.\u00c2\u00a0 But in the 90\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it was part of the standard uniform.\u00c2\u00a0 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to believe, but just over a decade ago, this incomplete facial hair formation, could actually increase a guy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chances of having sex \u00e2\u0080\u0093 especially when coupled with long hair.\u00c2\u00a0 It was a look that said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey world, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a beard. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not clean-shaven either.\u00c2\u00a0 You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t define me with your boring rules. \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00c2\u00a0 And seriously what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sexier than that?\nIn 2010, the goatee comes back stronger than ever. Why? Because of this column.\u00c2\u00a0 The power of the internet, baby.\u00c2\u00a0 Tomorrow morning, every guy who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s read this will stare in his bathroom mirror overcome by a certain sensation.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood lord, Gladstone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s onto something!\u00c2\u00a0 What if the ladies couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see the skin immediately around my mouth?\u00c2\u00a0 What if it appeared from the proper distance that I had a cinnamon donut stuck to my face?\u00c2\u00a0 Good lord, how much tail would that get me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 You may doubt it now, but it's already in play.\u00c2\u00a0 You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re already on your way. Congratulations, sexy! In fact, I just started a facebook group called \u00e2\u0080\u009c Goatees for 2010 \u00e2\u0080\u009d to get this baby going.\u00c2\u00a0 If the group gets, over 100 members with pics posted, I promise to post too. (I understand it will take a few days to get the facial hair in place).\u00c2\u00a0 I will also do my best to get the other Cracked columnists to do so \u00e2\u0080\u0093 understanding, of course that Daniel O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Brien and Michael Swaim may lack the testerone-based fortitude to achieve such things.\n5. Full House\nHey remember one of the worst sitcoms ever? No? Why? Because you were 5? Oh.\u00c2\u00a0 Well what about syndication? Yes, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m talking about Full House. That show about a Jewish guy who was somehow named Tanner and not actually Jewish who had to raise two baby troll dolls after his wife died. Thinking fast, he recruits John Stamos and Dave Coulier to help out.\u00c2\u00a0 The show ran from 1987 to 1995 and I imagine it sucked the entire length of that time, but truth be told, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure I ever saw a full episode. In any event, in 2010, Full House returns.\u00c2\u00a0 Not a remake.\u00c2\u00a0 All the same actors return in modern day.\u00c2\u00a0 The make-shift family will reunite to help the Olson twins deal with their eating disorders.\u00c2\u00a0 Bob Saget, once known for being funny and one of the dirtiest stand ups prior to Full House, will now drop F bombs non stop.\u00c2\u00a0 And Dave Coulier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s catch phrase will be \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey, y\u00e2\u0080\u0099know Alanis Morrissette was totally talking about going down on me in that theater.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe me?\u00c2\u00a0 Doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sound right for TV? What if I told you the cast did the whole show in black face and it was called Tyler Perry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Full House of Payne?\u00c2\u00a0 Yep. Believe it.\u00c2\u00a0 Enjoy your 2010, guys.\nSubscribe to Gladstone's site .

They want their soul patch back\nGetty Images\nEvery decade has its style, whether it\u2019s top hats and monocles or parachute pants and Airwalks. Facial hair is no different. Every mutton chop, soul patch, and handlebar mustache belongs to its own special time\u2014and just because these guys belong in the modern decade doesn\u2019t mean their beards do. Here are 13 modern men with decade-specific facial fuzz. Where does yours belong?\n1860: The Chin Curtain\nBefore the Civil War, gents favored a clean shave. In fact, Abe Lincoln was the first bearded president. With him came the \u201cchin curtain,\u201d a beard that starts just above your jaw line and goes straight down. Abe made his extra chin-y by wearing it without a mustache , and to be perfectly honest, no one has pulled it off since.\nThe face-flanking beasts known as sideburns didn\u2019t get their name until the spectacularly scruffy Civil War general Ambrose Burnside rose to fame. His cottony white cheek fluff grew to magnificent length and connected over his lip, leaving his chin bare. It\u2019s a look that makes a man look like a zany inventor\u2014or a meme.\n1880/90: The Full Bush\nThanks to history's two hairiest presidents\u2014Rutherford Hayes and, briefly, James Garfield\u2014the last part of the century was a beard-growin' free-for-all. In this bushy period, long before the invention of the electric clipper, facial hair was allowed to be free. There is a strong possibility that your facial hair right now is nostalgic for this era.\n1900/10: The Handlebar Mustache\n\u00a0\n1920: The Distinguished Uncle\nWhile the young gents of the roaring \u201820s were ducking in and out of speakeasies, full beards made a comeback on a distinguished set of older gents. Think snowy-haired industrialists and railroad tycoons . Or Harrison Ford in one of his don\u2019t-be-fooled-by-the-gray-I-can-still-knock-you-out phases.\nFirst there was the Charlie Chaplin mustache\u2014also known as the \u201ctoothbrush mustache\u201d because it was about the size and shape of a toothbrush. Let\u2019s not talk about that one. It went out of fashion hard. Then came the \u201cpencil mustache,\u201d popularized by Clark Gable. This thin strip across the upper lip stays out of the way of the nose, and looks down upon heavier mustaches.\n1940/50: Birth of the Goatee\nDizzy Gillespie brought in the soul patch, and the Beatnik movement birthed the goatee. The early look was neat and thin\u2014think of it as a natural outgrowth of the pencil mustache. An outgrowth that could be thoughtfully stroked in a smoky jazz club.\n1960: The Goatee Grows Up\nCounter culture. Coffee houses. Che Guevara. It was time to let those goatees be free. Mustaches reconnected with noses. Soul patches attained the length that would eventually qualify them as \u201cflavor savors.\u201d Men let their facial hair be, well, hairy, with the concept of \u201cscruff\u201d joining the revolution.\n1970: The Horseshoe Mustache\nThe \u201870s were a huge decade for hair in general. Guys quit going to the barber. The Bee Gees were a thing. The explosion of facial hair provided the perfect canvas for the decade\u2019s greatest invention: the horseshoe mustache. It will forever belong to Hulk Hogan, but it\u2019s available to any guy who wants to throw on a trucker hat and crush a beer in his fist.\nThe \u201880s were a mustache cage match, and there was one winner: Tom Selleck. This paragon of manhood introduced the world to his full, luxurious, lip ornament on \u201cMagnum PI.\u201d We shudder to think of him without it. Stay strong, Tom. For you, every month is Movember.\nRemember those well-behaved midcentury goatees? The \u201890s made the goatee-soul-patch combo the new facial hair of alt rock. It became bold and thick. We\u2019re looking at you, Fred Durst, Kid Rock, Rob Zombie\u2014the list goes on. With the right attitude, any guy can still embrace this \u201890s vibe.\u00a0\n2000: Five o\u2019 Clock Shadow Plus\nThe early aughts were all about almost growing a beard. Think Keanu Reeves and Colin Farrell with soft patches of scruff dappling their jaw lines. It was a soft look that said, \u201cNever mind my beard, girl, get lost in my eyes.\u201d It was self-assured but not hyper-masculine. Which meant another big beard \u00a0blast was imminent.\n2010: Lumbersexuals\nGrow \u2018em long. Grow \u2018em strong. The \u201ctwenty-teens\u201d have been defined by the biggest beard volumes in over a century. Wild and scraggly, billowing, and unkempt, these are the beards of guys who just rode in from the frontier, and are now enjoying a chai latte at their boutique design firm. But, hey, when you can impress people with the sheer number of days it\u2019s been since you last shaved, why not keep it up another week? Or another decade.\n{* loginWidget *}\n{* /signInForm *}             By logging in, you confirm that you accept our terms of service and have read and understand privacy policy .\nSign In\nAlmost Done!\nPlease confirm the information below before signing in.\n{* #socialRegistrationForm *}         {* emailAddress *}         {* displayName *}         By clicking \"Sign in\", you confirm that you accept our terms of service and have read and understand privacy policy .\n{* backButton *}\n{* /socialRegistrationForm *}\nAlmost Done!\nPlease confirm the information below before signing in.

Both men helped popularize the goatee in the 17th century. (Photo:\u00a0 Public Domain/WikiCommons ) \u00a0\nThis year\u2019s Golden State Warriors basketball team is an extraordinary bunch, shattering records left and right\u2014and yet, there\u2019s something deeply strange about them.\nThe bulk of the team has either currently has or recently had the same facial hair as Guy Fieri, your least favorite uncle, or Edward Norton during most of the \u201990s.\nStephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Harrison Barnes, Andre Iguodala, Brandon Rush, Shaun Livingston, and many other members of the defending NBA championship team have at various times sported a goatee, but in contrast to Mr. Fieri, can also be easily described as stylish and fashionable young men.\nFor many, the goatee is a symbol of \u201890s rebellion that\u2019s faded into a classic Midwestern Dad look, a comfortably uncool style of facial hair. But while facial hair styles wax and wane over the years and decades and centuries, facial hair experts agree: We\u2019re in a pretty strange time for men\u2019s facial hair, one not quite like any time in history.\nTo look at the history of the goatee we have to first decide what a goatee actually is. \u201cWell, there\u2019s no official arbiter of all knowledge on this matter,\u201d laughed Christopher Oldstone-Moore, an academic at Wright State University who studies masculinity and especially beards. (He\u2019s also the author of Of Beards and Men: The Revealing History of Facial Hair .) Oldstone-Moore says that the goatee is a partial beard, meaning parts of the face are clean-shaven and parts are not, and that it must always include the chin. Variations from there abound; the connected, trimmed circle of hair around the mouth is most often called a \u201cfull goatee\u201d or just \u201cgoatee,\u201d though the University of Toronto\u2019s Allan Peterkin, author of One Thousand Beards: A Cultural History of Facial Hair , refers to this as a \u201ccircle beard.\u201d\nSteph Curry of the Golden State Warriors. (Photo:\u00a0 Keith Allison/flickr )\nIf the mustache and chin-beard are not connected, this can sometimes be called a goatee, but is more often defined more precisely based on its length and styling. Sometimes it\u2019s a \u201cVan Dyke,\u201d but if allowed to grow longer and pointier, it\u2019s known as an \u201cimperial.\u201d\nThe history of the goatee is curious and often erroneous. The name certainly comes from the peculiar long fur underneath the chin of a billy goat. As a result of that, the half-man, half-goat Greek god Pan is usually depicted as having a goatee of some sort. Pan was the god of shepherds, but also was a symbol of wildness. And in turn, as imagery from the Greeks (and elsewhere) was subsumed into Christianity, depictions of Satan often included goat-like, or Pan-like, features: of course the enemy of Christianity would be the primitive, pagan, wild god of the Greeks. But this, thinks Oldstone-Moore, was pretty much coincidental. \u201cYou almost never see ancient people wearing what we think of as a goatee,\u201d he says. \u201cI think of the goatee as a modern beard. I don\u2019t think it has a very ancient history at all.\u201d The ancient Egyptians did sometimes wear a false beard, often metallic, known as a postiche, but the line between jewelry and beard is kind of fuzzy there; Egyptians did not usually grow a beard in the shape of the postiche.\nThe goatee really caught on in the 17th century thanks to a Flemish painter named Anthony van Dyck. Van Dyck was a hugely successful portrait painter who completed paintings of various dukes and queens and princesses and, notably, Charles I. But he also painted many self-portraits, and van Dyck wore a trim partial beard: a small pointed chin-beard and a delicately curved mustache. Charles I wore this style of beard as well, and paintings of both van Dyck and Charles circulated throughout Europe. The beard style of these two men became enormously popular, and was eventually named after the painter, with a slight mutation in spelling to Van Dyke.\n\u201cThough it was popular in Europe in the 17th century, in the form of the Van Dyke, goatees and all other facial hair practically disappeared in polite circles in the 18th and early 19th century,\u201d says Sean Trainor, who\u2019s written about the history of facial hair for the Atlantic . Soon enough, it began popping up in less polite circles, and the beard style became associated with soldiers, appearing on the Three Musketeers and Napoleon Bonaparte, and on through to the American Wild West, where it was worn by General Custer and Buffalo Bill. \u201cThe goatee has some kind of connection with someone who is a very forceful, assertive person,\u201d says Oldstone-Moore.\nThe God Pan, frequently depicted with a goatee. (Photo: Public Domain/WikiCommons )\nBut facial hair trends come in waves, and those waves became shorter and shorter as globalization sped up communications in the 20th century. By the early to mid-1900s, beard styles were rotating out almost by decade: the 1920s and 1930s in the U.S. were primarily beardless, but small beards, including some we\u2019d recognize as goatees, were fashionable among the Beats and jazz musicians in the 1940s. In the 1950s, clean-shaven was the only way to go, but by the 1960s, full beards were in\u2014a sign of rebellion against the square decade that came before. That backed off in the 1970s, when the most popular facial hair style was the mustache, but bounced back in the 1980s, when stubble, at most, was popular.\nIn the 1990s is where things get more complicated. As a fashion era, that decade was about excess: Swarovski crystals, giant baggy clothes, huge retail chains, more, more, more. And yet the beard style was relatively modest: a trim goatee or soul patch. Oldstone-Moore thinks this is because facial hair moves in short waves, from full to partial beards to no beards and back again\u2014he thinks it\u2019s unlikely that a trend would move from clean-shaven to a full beard. Peterkin agrees; specific facial hair styles, he says, don\u2019t necessarily have any consistent meaning to them. Sporting a goatee in the 1940s made a plenty big enough statement just because sporting any facial hair at all firmly set the wearer against the clean-shaven era just past.\nW.F \u201cBuffalo Bill\u201d Cody, in 1875. (Photo: Public Domain/WikiCommons )\nBut now, a more rebellious beard would be what Peterkin calls a \u201cmountain man\u201d beard, because the previous era, the 1990s, wasn\u2019t clean shaven. These days, the goatee is the status quo, the safe bet, the mainstream look. \u201cNeither conservatively clean-shaved nor radically shaggy, the goatee speaks to the consensus-minded 90s, not to our own moment of extremes,\u201d says Trainor. To place yourself as a something outside the mainstream, you have to go more extreme, a giant beard or rougher beard of some sort. (Going clean shaven is not usually a good way to protest; there are always enough clean-shaven men that going clean-shaven never makes much of a statement.) \u201cWhen I hear the word goatee, the first people that spring to mind are pot-bellied MLB pitchers, aging country music singers, C-list celebrities like Larry the Cable Guy and Guy Fieri, and suburban cops,\u201d says Trainor.\nBut there are other ways to understand the cultural meaning of facial hair. \u201cThe racial line is quite striking in every respect when it comes to facial hair,\u201d says Oldstone-Moore. Beard styles among black men do not follow in really any way the patterns of beard styles among white men. The mustache, for example, is a particularly fraught facial hair style among white men, with infrequent periods of fashionability and recurrences as a mocking or joking one all other times. Not so among black men: \u201cAfrican-American men have always worn the mustache, and not as a trend,\u201d says Peterkin.\nA publicity still from the 1921 film, The Three Musketeers. (Photo: Public Domain/WikiCommons )\nAccording to these beard experts, the goatee exists in a different state of fashionability amongst black men compared with white men. Although despite the heavily goateed Golden State Warriors, Trainor thinks the goatee is on the wane as well\u2014just not quite as far down as it is among white men. \u201cBut, even among black men, I think the goatee is a fading fashion \u2013 with the beards of everyone from Drake, Common, and Lebron James to Willard Scott and Rick Ross filling the cultural space that was once occupied by the goatee,\u201d he says. I\u2019m not so sure the goatee is exactly on the wane, but certainly it\u2019s true that the goatee is barely seen as a beard in the NBA. On lists of the NBA\u2019s best beards, it\u2019s rare to find more than one or two goatees, even spectacular ones like DeAndre Jordan\u2019s .\nThere is yet another element to the goatee that gives it perennial popularity: it\u2019s very easy to grow. For men in their late teens or early 20s whose beards are not that full yet, the goatee is much more popular, because the hair on the upper lip and the chin comes in more densely than in any other part of the face. It\u2019s not just age that can make growing full beards difficult: \u201cDifferent ethnic groups have different capacities to grow facial hair,\u201d says Peterkin. \u201cLike American Indians for example often can\u2019t grow full beards. And for black men there\u2019s often issues with ingrown hairs and so forth while trying to grow beards.\u201d African-American hair tends to be a bit curlier than the hair of those with primarily European descent, which often leads to a patchier or more difficult-to-grow beard; curly hairs can irritate the delicate skin of the face. A goatee might be the only option\u2014but that doesn\u2019t mean men of all races won\u2019t try all sorts of beards.\nThis all ties in with one trend that connects facial hair of all men. \u201cPreviously in history, if you had a beard, you would keep it for life, it was part of who you were,\u201d says Peterkin. \u201cBut now people go back and forth.\u201d Steph Curry, for example, has been clean-shaven, has had a full beard, has had a connected goatee, has had only a chin-beard, and has had a disconnected goatee, all within the past few years. With rare exceptions like James Harden, the beard is not necessarily a fundamental part of a man\u2019s identity anymore; it\u2019s a fun thing to play with, that you can change with the seasons or just however you feel. And some days, you just feel like a postiche.\nEnjoying This Story?\nGet our latest, delivered straight to your inbox by subscribing to our newsletter .\nSubscribe to our newsletter and get our latest, sent right to your inbox.\nSubscribe\nRelated Stories\nThanks for subscribing!\nAdd Some Wonder to Your Inbox\nEvery weekday we compile our most wondrous stories and deliver them straight to you.\nSubscribe\nWe'd Like You to Like Us\nLike Atlas Obscura and get our latest and greatest stories in your Facebook feed.\n"

                            "text": "Here Are the Most Popular Beard Styles Over the Past 16 Decades\nBeards seem to be having a moment.\nBut really, they've been having one for years.\nThe rise of the \"Postmillennial He-Man Beard Epoch\" has been with us for some time, with one\u00a0New York Times writer pegging it to around 2007, when he\u00a0 noticed \u00a0his middle-aged beard seemed suddenly trendy with the younger men around him. Fast forward a few years\u00a0and the\u00a0 \"lumbersexual\" revolution \u00a0hit hard, with beards paired with plaid shirts for a \" Ron Swanson mixed with Ryan Gosling \" look. Now, gone are the plaid shirts \u2014 2015 is about the\u00a0 beard-and-man-bun combo .\nThe recent facial hair enthusiasm might give the impression young men have just discovered beards. But facial hair isn't a modern novelty \u2014\u00a0there's always the question of how to shape what we've got. Trends cycle in and out, as any photo of a\u00a0 Civil War general \u00a0will remind you. The latter half of the 1800s was a beard bonanza, while in the 1920s, beards became rarer and rarer (thanks, in no small part, to the introduction of\u00a0 commercialized shaving razors \u00a0by Gillette).\u00a0\nBy the 1950s, the number of men with beards was at an \u00a0all-time low , only to be revived by hippie culture in the late 1960s and 1970s. By then, businessmen were\u00a0 growing beards \u00a0\u2014 as evidenced by the\u00a0 facial hair evolution \u00a0on\u00a0Mad Men \u2014\u00a0only to morph into those regrettable goatees of the late ' 90s -early aughts.\nCheck out the photos to see how far our faces have come.\nBeards had a serious \"moment\" from the 1850s to 1880s.\nThe early 1850s was a time of restrained elegance and style; by the 1880s, beards were everywhere. A beard signaled masculinity and health , and there were endless varieties. Some beards precariously off the bottom of men's faces, while some came with mustaches (something Gen.\u00a0Ulysses S. Grant and\u00a0Gen.\u00a0Stonewall Jackson could both agree upon).\u00a0\nBy the 1920s and 1930s, old men owned the bearded look.\nThink about it: Gatsby didn't have a beard. In the 1920s and 1930s, beards were no longer counted among trendy facial hair. By the looks of archival photos, mostly men of a certain age wore beards.\nIn the 1940 and '50s, facial hair was rare. Unless, of course, you had a goatee.\u00a0\nFacial hair was still a pretty uncommon during that time, but the goatee made its way into popular culture by way of counterculture movements like the beatniks and influential jazz musicians in the '40s (including Dizzy\u00a0Gillespie , one of the only men who made a soul patch look good).\nBy the 1960s, beards were a symbol of creativity and rebelliousness.\nA clean-shaven look was still popular in the early 1960s (again, see the early seasons of Mad Men ). There were, however, some beard trends, like the goatee and scruffy beard. But judging by archival photos, they were worn mostly by creative types like writers, filmmakers and revolutionaries like Che Guevara. Definitely not a style for the office.\nWith the rise of hippie culture and disco in the '70s, full beards made a comeback.\nIn the 1970s facial hair and men's grooming were more varied than before. Hairstyling wasn't just for women and men generally embraced a more hairy look overall. The influence of bands like the Beatles and Bee Gees also can't be ignored. Overgrown beards were in style but mustaches reigned supreme .\nThe rise of '90s alternative bands brought with it goatees and soul patches.\nMen embraced a clean-shaven look in the decade after the '70s, thanks in part to the rise of corporate culture and political conservatism . There were certainly the occasional and iconic mustaches \u00a0(think: Tom Selleck in Magnum P.I.) but a full-on beard wasn't in style\u00a0 in the workplace , forcing many to adopt baby smooth skin.\nThat all began changing in the early '90s when popular alternative bands became more mainstream. Musicians in bands like Nirvana, Anthrax and Everclear wore a range of facial hairstyles ranging from the soul patch to dyed beards.\u00a0\nIn the early 2000s, things got a little scruffy and patchy.\nAfter the soul patch of the '90s, a hybrid of the goatee and scruffy beard look became more popular. Celebrities like Keanu Reeves, Matt LeBlanc and Colin Farrell grew beards that evoked a nonchalant attitude. The extra-shaggy goatee remained popular also\u00a0 thanks in part\u00a0 to stars like Brad Pitt and Johnny Depp.\nThankfully, we've achieved bearded perfection: the man bun-and-beard combo.\n* praise hands *\n"

Even in the heat of the summer, the hairy trend continues to prevail. Still, if you think that\u2019s crazy, you probably missed the \u201990s.\nFrom about 1990-1998, some very weird facial hairstyles dominated the music world. There were a lot of incomplete goatees and quite a few runaway beards. Don\u2019t believe us? Check out some of the craziest and most \u201990s facial hair below\u2013 but we\u2019re warning you, you can never un-see what you\u2019re about to witness.\n1 The Floating Goatee\nGetty Images\nA goatee is just a small patch of hair located on the chin. Seemingly simple, yet in the \u201990s, a lot of musicians literally missed the mark. John Dolmayan style was the perfect example of this nonchalant look, he had a soul patch just above his chin, so it wasn\u2019t quite a goatee, but it can\u2019t be disregarded all together. Hence, a new category is born: \u201cthe floater.\u201d\n2 The Chin Mane\nGetty Images\nThis exaggerated style still lives on today\u2013 ahem, Brad Pitt\u2013 but it was all the rage for rockers back in the day. Anthrax\u2019s lead guitarist Scott Ian not only sported this look, but he often dyed his mane. We\u2019re guessing to match his mood.\n3 The Braided Beard\nGetty Images\nShavo Odadjian clearly takes the cake when it comes to braided beards. The man had facial hair longer than the hair on most people\u2019s head. It wasn\u2019t a good luck, but it was very \u201990s.\n4 The Landing Strip\n5 Animal Style Sideburns\nGetty Images\nSideburns alone aren\u2019t a \u201990s trend, but grooming those bad boys to your jawline? That\u2019s something that most men avoid these days. Back in his Limp Bizkit prime, Wes Borland sported some of the creepiest sideburns we\u2019ve ever seen. (Seriously, if his appearance in the \u201cNookie\u201d video doesn\u2019t haunt you, we don\u2019t know what will.)\n6 The Hourglass Conundrum\nGetty Images\nFred Durst rocked this style loud and proud in the \u201990s. His thin and oddly shaped beard closely resembled an hourglass.\n7 The Dot\nGetty Images\nThis style is similar to the \u201cfloating goatee\u201d with considerably less effort. As the name suggests, it is a literal dash of hair under your lip. Not very logical, but it was a trend all the same.\n8 The 3-piece Masterpiece: A Combination Style\n[image src=\"wp-attachment://46414\"]\nAlthough this style combines three already horrible looks on the list, it has to stand on it\u2019s own for all of the musicians who rocked this exact look. Late Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain wore it best. Not only did Kurt\u2019s mustache connect to his beard, but he took it a step further by having a thin, two-part goatee that wasn\u2019t connected to anything.\n"

A general guide is a straight line down from the corner of your mouth. It's your call if you want to connect it to your mustache or not. Shave the lower border line at the bottom of your chin bone. Then set it in stone with a wet shave. Cheeks and neck will need to be shaved on a daily basis to stop the goatee from looking like a peculiarly shaped beard.

                            "text": "What Does a Goatee Say About You?\nFrom Brad Pitt to Chuck Todd to Larry the Cable Guy, all types of men are wearing goatees. Bryan Curtis on the beard for all seasons. Plus, a gallery of A-list whiskers.\n11.12.09 6:13 PM ET\nBreaking: Brad Pitt has a full-blown goatee. It\u2019s long and gray and bushy, and when Pitt showed it off last week at a movie premiere, it was beaded in a style favored by the pirates of the Caribbean. If there were ever a time to reassess the state of facial hair, this would seem to be it. It used to be that growing a goatee was some kind of fashion statement. Now the goatee has become the Gap T-shirt of beards. The New New Goatee can be worn at home or at the office, by the hip and unhip alike, signifying, well, just about anything.\nClick Image to View Our Gallery of Goatees\nThe New New Goatee is a beard for all seasons, as harmless as a tattoo. This becomes apparent by reviewing a list of Americans who have been sporting goatees lately: Kobe Bryant, Tim McGraw, Pastor Rick Warren, chef Rick Bayless, NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd, Todd Palin, Larry the Cable Guy, even Mariah Carey in her latest music video. \u201cThere is no kinship at all,\u201d Chuck Todd, who is a good sport for answering his phone, tells me. Larry the Cable Guy does not concur: \u201cI think Brad Pitt might have the goatee just because I pulled it off so good,\u201d he says.\nWhat does a New New Goatee mean? First you have to understand that the goatee has always been hard to pin down. Shakespeare had one, as did the Flemish painter Anthony van Dyck, whom the Van Dyke was named after. (For simplicity\u2019s sake, I have grouped the Van Dyke and the goatee together, even though the Van Dyke is the official name for the lip-chin combo.) \u201cImagery often shows Pan or the Devil with a goatee,\u201d says Allan Peterkin, the author of One Thousand Beards: A Cultural History of Facial Hair . In the 20th century, the goatee was alluring enough to attract Lenin and Buffalo Bill, Burl Ives and Dizzy Gillespie, Colonel Sanders and Malcolm X, Dobie Gillis\u2019 Maynard G. Krebs and Spike Lee, Anthrax\u2019s Scott Ian and Kurt Cobain. It was Cobain and his grunge mates who resurrected the goatee from its Beat obsolescence in the 1990s. Though the goatee retains little of their residue of cool\u2014if you\u2019re at the cutting edge of facial hair, you\u2019re wearing a full Zach Galifianakis \u2014it is oddly more prominent in mainstream American life than ever.\nThe New New Goatee sometimes symbolizes brainy gravitas. This is most notable in Chuck Todd, NBC\u2019s chief White House correspondent. Todd\u2019s ginger goatee, which he grew in the summer of 2002, is a bracing counterpoint to clean-shaven mugs like Brian Williams\u2019. \u201cIt highlights that nobody on TV has facial hair,\u201d Todd says. But those carefully trimmed whiskers are part of Todd\u2019s magic. A veteran of the D.C. insider tip sheet The Hotline, Todd is NBC\u2019s numbers guy, its Election Day stats guru. In the blowhard universe of TV news, Todd\u2019s pronouncements seem to carry real weight\u2014you actually believe he knows what he\u2019s talking about. Todd\u2019s goatee confers upon him the same kind of authority as a political-science professor\u2019s goatee.\nLast month, when Todd lost a public bet with ABC News correspondent Jake Tapper and appeared poised to shave off the goatee, blogger Dan Amira compared it to Samson\u2019s locks. Todd made a $2,000 donation to charity and kept the goatee by a whisker.\nAnother take on the New New Goatee: It is a symbol of bloggy, stay-at-home cred. \u201cI wish I were part of some grand sociological trend,\u201d says Jonah Goldberg, the goateed conservative pundit and frequent blogger on National Review Online. \u201cBut I mostly do it because I work from home and it makes it easier to go very long periods of time without shaving.\u201d\nThe New New Goatee can signify both youth and maturity. Billy Joel\u2019s goatee is a sign of an older man trying to recapture his youth. Michael Phelps\u2019 goatee is a sign of a golden boy trying to look older.\nThere are, of course, aesthetic considerations. \u201cFirst and foremost, they\u2019re thinning,\u201d says Larry the Cable Guy. When he debuted as a morning radio personality in the 1990s, Larry\u2019s act was delightfully offensive but his face was baby-smooth. \u201cI looked like a kid, a punk, no facial hair, nothing,\u201d he says. Larry grew a full beard, but that was a smidge too country\u2014\u201cI looked like an Oak Ridge Boy \u201d\u2014so he pruned it down into a goatee. Paired with a baseball cap and sleeveless shirt, these days Larry looks like he has just exited a Golden Corral buffet. He has redneck gravitas.\nDon\u2019t like your New New Goatee? Simply change an accessory or two. Add some pricey eyewear, and a goatee can make you hip, as it does Johnny Depp. Doff your shirt, and it can make you all-powerful, as it does Shane Carwin of the Ultimate Fighting Championship. Stand in the vicinity of a Republican presidential candidate, and a goatee can make you look like the campaign\u2019s sage, as with McCain aide Mark Salter. A goatee can lend an otherwise unremarkable creature a touch of menace. Google News turns up dozens of criminal suspects like this one from Oregon over the weekend: \u201ca white male about 5 feet 9 inches or 6 feet tall and weighing between 160 and 180 pounds. He may have a goatee.\u201d Ooga-boogah!\nHow did we end up with all this chin foliage? On the one hand, the New New Goatee is the case of something hip becoming something mainstream. It is also the case of the American office becoming a more casual place; Allan Peterkin notes that about the only people who can\u2019t have goatees nowadays are politicians and bankers. The New New Goatee is also a sign of our neo-Bohemia, where formal culture has mixed with hipster culture and created a mix of the two: the Wall Street trader who wears a goatee with his Michael Kors suit.\nPitt reportedly grew his goatee for his role in The Lost City of Z, a real-life Victorian adventure. But what you make of the facial growth depends on what you make of Pitt. Some cast it as a youthful star finally confronting middle age (\u201cMeet Joe Grey,\u201d quipped The Daily Mail). Others have suggested he grew it just because he knew he would still look great. When Pitt attempted an earlier version of the look in January, there was at least one howl of outrage from a female fan at the Golden Globes, who was apparently convinced Pitt was hiding his magnificent face.\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!\nDaily Digest\nStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.\nCheat Sheet\nA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).\nSubscribe\nThank You!\nYou are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.\nWhat ultimately persuaded NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd to preserve his goatee, however, was not aesthetics but an inter-generational sentiment: His dad sported a red beard before him. \u201cAfter my dad died,\u201d says Todd, \u201cI saw my red beard, and it was like this one, odd commonality I had with my old man. I didn\u2019t want to shave it. It\u2019s like I\u2019d be letting him down.\u201d\nIt is a sweet sentiment, and hints at goateed depths we have yet to plumb.

                            "text": "The Most Embarrassing '90s Beauty Trends\nIf you're looking for cringeworthy beauty ideas, the '90s are all that and a bag of chips. Eyebrows were drawn on with Sharpies, highlights were streaky, and everything had glitter in it. We tied a flannel around our waist and traveled down the nostalgia rabbit hole to find the best of the worst.\nBy Meirav Devash\nApril 30, 2015\nPhotos: Getty Images\nSkinny Brows\nIn the '90s, only Brooke Shields was allowed to have full eyebrows. Everyone else was required by law to tweeze away almost everything and then draw it back in with a superthin line. Our brave ancestors relied on their friends to survive the brow drought. Former BFFs Courtney Love and Drew Barrymore may not have had very much eyebrow left here, but they had each other.\nSkinny Brows\nGwen Stefani, the embodiment of a decade, took her penciled brows one step beyond by placing a jeweled bindi between them, then adding crystals along the bottom lash line that made it look like she was crying.\nSkinny Brows\nYou know what really highlights a pair of pencil-thin brows? Charlize Theron's platinum crop and tiny adolescent-style bangs.\nSkinny Brows\nWe're as surprised as Pamela Anderson's eyebrows are that she dated Bret Michaels in 1994\u2014we totally repressed that memory.\nThe Fountain Head\nBefore Ariana Grande and the ponytail conspiracy theories she inspired (it's a wig; she's covering a third eye in the back of her head; it's where her antennae are hidden), wearing a high ponytail fountain jutting out of the crown of your head was kind of common. Janet \"Miss Jackson If You're Nasty\" Jackson did it with long braids and a turban.\nThe Fountain Head\nBritney Spears MacGyvered a white scrunchie out of...a Hanes T-shirt? A cloth diaper? Your guess is as good as ours.\nThe Fountain Head\nPaula Abdul reached heights Ariana Grande could only dream of with a simple black hair wrap.\nThe Fountain Head\nDanielle Fishel gave us a honey-brown hair waterfall to chase after (even though TLC warned us not to).\nWhy Tendrils? Why?\nEvery rose had its thorn, and every updo had its tendrils. The idea was noble\u2014updos look stiff, so why not pull out some face-framing pieces to soften the look? Layering wasn't the art it is now, so the strands tended to just dangle there uselessly, slightly obstructing your vision. Julia Stiles wore the popular windshield-wiper version in 10 Things I Hate About You.\nWhy Tendrils? Why?\nKate Moss glammed it up on the runway and almost pulled it off. She is Kate Moss, after all.\nWhy Tendrils? Why?\nMelissa Joan Hart turned one big tendril into a sagging sausage curl. Very prom-chic.\nWhy Tendrils? Why?\nClaire Danes worked her weird tendrils with a bob and some tiny butterfly clips.\nWhy Tendrils? Why?\nJennifer Aniston went full Medusa with tendrils on tendrils and a Claire's Accessories store's worth of tiny hair clips.\nPorcupine Updos\nAnother way to make your updo more exciting was to make sure the ends of your hair were spiky instead of tucking them in with bobby pins. This way, they poked out in all directions and confused the eye. Claire Danes got a young Leonardo DiCaprio's attention with these broomlike bristles.\nAlicia Silverstone combined spikes with tendrils and butterfly clips for a '90s-trend trifecta.\nBlue Eye-Shadow Overload\nThe thing about wearing '90s blue eye shadow is that basically any amount is too much. (Need we remind you of the Mimi Bobeck character on The Drew Carey Show?) Here, baby Reese Witherspoon looks like she got into her mom's makeup bag and went to town.\nBlue Eye-Shadow Overload\nJennifer Lopez brought her frosty blue shadow all the way up to the brow.\nBlue Eye-Shadow Overload\nBack in her dark, edgy days, Angelina Jolie went for the clown-paint approach: pale skin, high arches, and a creepy Joker smile.\nSo Much Body Glitter\nDuring this weird blip in time, decorating yourself with glitter powders, gels, and sprays was acceptable\u2014even encouraged. And no one thought this made them look like a stripper. Britney Spears liberally applied body glitter to her d\u00e9collet\u00e9 and shoulders, creating a vaguely sweaty effect.\nCrunchy Hair\nBefore co-washing and sulfate awareness, most hair products had the same alcohol content as Everclear. Texture was really important, whether you rocked braids, waves, or crispy curls. (Touchability, not so much.) Cameron Diaz hit the crimping iron hard for this Top Ramen hair look.\nCrunchy Hair\nChristina Aguilera fluffed her egg-noodle curls up and out and set them with shellac.\nCrunchy Hair\nLook at Kirsten Dunst! Her shiny zigzags are crisp and hot off the crimper.\nCrunchy Hair\nOne way to get crimps without hot tools was to put your hair in braids before going to sleep. Looks like Kate Moss was about to do just that (after putting out her cigarette).\nCrazy Accent Braids\nCoachella, shmoachella. The '90s had its own brand of boho hair, and it didn't involve wearing an oversize floral crown. Randomly placed braids were one way to signify that you were laid-back, maaaan. Madonna's take was very Sea Hag Chic: center-parted, disheveled beach waves with ropy braids.\nScarlett Johansson's hair wraps were like wearing friendship bracelets in your hair.\nCrazy Accent Braids\nFiona Apple decided to wear all the hair textures\u2014straight, frizzy, curly, and braided\u2014for a raised-by-wolves vibe.\nCulturally Insensitive Cornrows\nWe all went to the Bahamas in 1994 and collectively had the same terrible idea. Let's just pretend this never happened, OK, Juliette Lewis?\nBrown Lipstick\nNot red, not pink, but grungy brown lips were the thing. (There were so many lipsticks named after cocoa and raisins.) Women were drawn to the color because it was dark and moody, but not as try-hard as a vampy berry or goth burgundy. Mostly, it looked...muddy. T-Boz, Left-Eye, and Chilli of TLC all took time away from stapling condoms to their clothes to swipe it on.\nBrown Lipstick\nJulianne Moore looked like she was colored in with an auburn crayon\u2014her hair, eyebrows, smoky eye shadow, and lipstick were somehow all the same shade.\nJennifer Lopez gave her lips a coat of glossy wood varnish.\nBrown Lipstick\nDrew Barrymore went totally matte. A gray-blue undertone in the color helped simulate hypothermia.\nBrown Lipstick\nAnd then there was that frosted nude-mauve color that wasn't brown but definitely didn't look nude. It seems like Tori Spelling, Shannen Doherty, and Jennie Garth all shared the same tube of lipstick at this party, and it's the most '90s thing we've ever seen.\nTwo Barrettes\nCourtney Love, riot grrrls, and double-dutch jumpers had already called dibs on plastic barrettes. Then Jennifer Lopez really classed up the idea of doing your hair like an eight-year-old by adding diamonds.\nTwo Barrettes\nSalma Hayek wore double barrettes to a Giorgio Armani fashion show, but she looked like she was already rethinking it.\nMini Buns\nIt's around this time that women started wondering if wearing one bun was enough. Maybe the more, the better? Bj\u00f6rk started the trend, and everyone was charmed because she's an adorable little Icelandic pixie who wears way weirder stuff all the time.\nMini Buns\nGwen Stefani wore them, too, and everyone was already used to her half-shirt and bindi, so they let it slide.\nMini Buns\nBy the time Reese Witherspoon used baby buns to spice up her mom bob, the tide had already turned.\nChunky Highlights\nEveryone got highlights in the '90s, and they wanted to make sure you knew it. Lightened sections were big, bright, and super-obvious. Gwyneth Paltrow and Brad Pitt were unforgettable in their his-and-hers zebra stripes.\nChunky Highlights\nGeri Halliwell of the Spice Girls bleached just the front. The two-tone look was what she wanted, what she really, really wanted.\nChunky Highlights\nCourteney Cox tried it with darker colors in wine and brown.

                            "text": "Are you ready for the \"braided beard\" to make a comeback?\n8/8/2015\nFrom musicians to movie stars, everyone is rocking the full beard this year. Even in the heat of the summer, the hairy trend continues to prevail. Still, if you think that\u2019s crazy, you probably missed the \u201990s.\nFrom about 1990-1998, some very weird facial hairstyles dominated the music world. There were a lot of incomplete goatees and quite a few runaway beards. Don\u2019t believe us? Check out some of the craziest and most \u201990s facial hair below\u2013 but we\u2019re warning you, you can never un-see what you\u2019re about to witness.\n1 The Floating Goatee\nGetty Images\nA goatee is just a small patch of hair located on the chin. Seemingly simple, yet in the \u201990s, a lot of musicians literally missed the mark. John Dolmayan style was the perfect example of this nonchalant look, he had a soul patch just above his chin, so it wasn\u2019t quite a goatee, but it can\u2019t be disregarded all together. Hence, a new category is born: \u201cthe floater.\u201d\n2 The Chin Mane\nGetty Images\nThis exaggerated style still lives on today\u2013 ahem, Brad Pitt\u2013 but it was all the rage for rockers back in the day. Anthrax\u2019s lead guitarist Scott Ian not only sported this look, but he often dyed his mane. We\u2019re guessing to match his mood.\n3 The Braided Beard\nGetty Images\nShavo Odadjian clearly takes the cake when it comes to braided beards. The man had facial hair longer than the hair on most people\u2019s head. It wasn\u2019t a good luck, but it was very \u201990s.\n4 The Landing Strip\n5 Animal Style Sideburns\nGetty Images\nSideburns alone aren\u2019t a \u201990s trend, but grooming those bad boys to your jawline? That\u2019s something that most men avoid these days. Back in his Limp Bizkit prime, Wes Borland sported some of the creepiest sideburns we\u2019ve ever seen. (Seriously, if his appearance in the \u201cNookie\u201d video doesn\u2019t haunt you, we don\u2019t know what will.)\n6 The Hourglass Conundrum\nGetty Images\nFred Durst rocked this style loud and proud in the \u201990s. His thin and oddly shaped beard closely resembled an hourglass.\n7 The Dot\nGetty Images\nThis style is similar to the \u201cfloating goatee\u201d with considerably less effort. As the name suggests, it is a literal dash of hair under your lip. Not very logical, but it was a trend all the same.\n8 The 3-piece Masterpiece: A Combination Style\n[image src=\"wp-attachment://46414\"]\nAlthough this style combines three already horrible looks on the list, it has to stand on it\u2019s own for all of the musicians who rocked this exact look. Late Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain wore it best. Not only did Kurt\u2019s mustache connect to his beard, but he took it a step further by having a thin, two-part goatee that wasn\u2019t connected to anything.\n"

Lilith Fair\nBack in the mid 90\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bunch of ladies saw the success of Lollapalooza and decided to show the world that sisters could do it for themselves.\u00c2\u00a0 Soon a group of somewhat talented artists banded together united only by their one hit wonder status and lack of a penis.\u00c2\u00a0 Shawn Colvin, Meredith Brooks, Paula Cole, and others.\u00c2\u00a0 (I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d include Sarah McLachlan, but she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s had more than one hit and that would ruin my wild generalization.\u00c2\u00a0 Also, she never replied after I wrote that letter about kissing her so hard, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just going to assume she actually does have \u00c2\u00a0a penis.) Well in 2010, Lillith Fair will return with a vengeance.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 And not with Lady Gaga and Ke$ha flying the grrl-power banner. \u00c2\u00a0No, instead, our old friends will take to the stage with new anthems like Brooks\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a Bitch (Just Like This Menopause);\u00c2\u00a0 Colvin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cSonny Never Visits Anymore;\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 and Paula Cole\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cPiss Off Gladstone, I Had Two Hits.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The feisty music-loving college girls of the 90s will now be able to purchase tickets at Starbucks, Talbots, and, of course, Gymboree.\n2. Bad Sex\nI hesitate to go here because after the Lillith Fair cracks I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d hate to be misunderstood as a misogynist.\u00c2\u00a0 But being misunderstood is what writing for the internet is all about.\u00c2\u00a0 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like a big game of \u00e2\u0080\u009cTelephone\u00e2\u0080\u009d that you play only with your deaf friends.\u00c2\u00a0 Who are also neurologically impaired. \u00c2\u00a0So here goes.\u00c2\u00a0 I know it may come as a surprise to you 21st century boys and girls, but women were different in the 90\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\u00c2\u00a0 This was before Sex and the City feminism took hold. Today, women hold onto the false delusion that they can empower themselves by tweeting \u00c2\u00a0frankly about how much they enjoy \u00c2\u00a0oral sex.\u00c2\u00a0 Where a frattish mentality of getting drunk and laid is somehow akin to saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a woman and I will not be denied !\u00e2\u0080\u009d Now, of course that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wrong-headed and false, but men don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t typically try to dispel that notion because, well why would we dissuade you from talking about oral sex?\u00c2\u00a0 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s much easier for dudes to say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re an independent woman. Now finish your beer and do that thing I like with the thing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nBut back in the 90\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, it was a different scene.\u00c2\u00a0 Intelligent, sexual women across the land (or at least at my University) wanted to run with the wolve s while reading Naomi Wolfe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Beauty Myth .\u00c2\u00a0 They couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t put on make up or shave their legs without asking, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy am I doing this; are these the tools of my oppression; and how does Gladstone get so dreamy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the stats to prove this, but in the 90\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fewer asses got spanked during sex then any decade in modern history.\u00c2\u00a0 The 69 rose in prominence as the only accepted egalitarian form of oral sex. And for the first time in history, a frank dialogue about the magic and glory of the menses was considered foreplay. Well, get ready, because in 2010, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all coming back.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u2193 Continue Reading Below\nSex and the City 2 will hit theaters and suddenly women will react in horror at the lifeless shell Carrie Bradshaw has become.\u00c2\u00a0 Soon Ani DiFranco records will start to sell again and French maid outfits will be returned in record numbers.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Your free ride is over fellas. Time to grow a pony tail and get some Indigo Girls records.\n3. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThanks for Sharing\u00e2\u0080\u009d/\u00e2\u0080\u009dToo Much Information\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nHistorians tell us that for a brief six week period in the fall of 1991, it was actually considered somewhat witty and/or clever to say \u00e2\u0080\u009cthanks for sharing\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009ctoo much information\u00e2\u0080\u009d when confronted with unwanted details from another\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal life.\u00c2\u00a0 We may never know why humor was ascribed to these phrases, but all our best data tells us it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true.\u00c2\u00a0 Indeed, even today, there are still clusters of humorless conversation trolls who feel empowered by using \u00c2\u00a0these phrases as if they were magical incantations, instantly transforming \u00c2\u00a0the speaker into a person more important than the addressee.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 They have no idea that every self-respecting human stopped saying this shortly before the start of the Clinton administration. Well they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in luck.\u00c2\u00a0 In 2010, a void will form in our language and welcome the unfortunate return of these phrases.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0Why?\u00c2\u00a0 Because in 2010 \u00e2\u0080\u009cFail\u00e2\u0080\u009d will finally leave the vernacular.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 (Incidentally, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmeh\u00e2\u0080\u009d will hold tight for another five years.) Soon, millions of the worst people in the world will be unsure what to say when being exposed to unexpected, unwanted information.\u00c2\u00a0 And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s when the TMI jargon returns. Some of you may be doubting this prediction.\u00c2\u00a0 How does it make sense to reply \u00e2\u0080\u009cthanks for sharing\u00e2\u0080\u009d to a youtube video you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t approve of? \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0Well , in truth, it makes no sense.\u00c2\u00a0 But then again, it was never really logical to say \u00e2\u0080\u009ctoo much information\u00e2\u0080\u009d to your co-worker when he was trying to open up to you about the death of his mother either.\n4. Goatees\nDid you misread that? Not Goatse . That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a 21st century creation.\u00c2\u00a0 No, I said \u00e2\u0080\u009cgoatee\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that tiny beard circling one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mouth that --much like Goatse-- \u00c2\u00a0actually does conjure thoughts of a-holes.\u00c2\u00a0 But in the 90\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it was part of the standard uniform.\u00c2\u00a0 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to believe, but just over a decade ago, this incomplete facial hair formation, could actually increase a guy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chances of having sex \u00e2\u0080\u0093 especially when coupled with long hair.\u00c2\u00a0 It was a look that said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey world, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a beard. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not clean-shaven either.\u00c2\u00a0 You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t define me with your boring rules. \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00c2\u00a0 And seriously what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sexier than that?\nIn 2010, the goatee comes back stronger than ever. Why? Because of this column.\u00c2\u00a0 The power of the internet, baby.\u00c2\u00a0 Tomorrow morning, every guy who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s read this will stare in his bathroom mirror overcome by a certain sensation.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood lord, Gladstone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s onto something!\u00c2\u00a0 What if the ladies couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see the skin immediately around my mouth?\u00c2\u00a0 What if it appeared from the proper distance that I had a cinnamon donut stuck to my face?\u00c2\u00a0 Good lord, how much tail would that get me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 You may doubt it now, but it's already in play.\u00c2\u00a0 You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re already on your way. Congratulations, sexy! In fact, I just started a facebook group called \u00e2\u0080\u009c Goatees for 2010 \u00e2\u0080\u009d to get this baby going.\u00c2\u00a0 If the group gets, over 100 members with pics posted, I promise to post too. (I understand it will take a few days to get the facial hair in place).\u00c2\u00a0 I will also do my best to get the other Cracked columnists to do so \u00e2\u0080\u0093 understanding, of course that Daniel O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Brien and Michael Swaim may lack the testerone-based fortitude to achieve such things.\n5. Full House\nHey remember one of the worst sitcoms ever? No? Why? Because you were 5? Oh.\u00c2\u00a0 Well what about syndication? Yes, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m talking about Full House. That show about a Jewish guy who was somehow named Tanner and not actually Jewish who had to raise two baby troll dolls after his wife died. Thinking fast, he recruits John Stamos and Dave Coulier to help out.\u00c2\u00a0 The show ran from 1987 to 1995 and I imagine it sucked the entire length of that time, but truth be told, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure I ever saw a full episode. In any event, in 2010, Full House returns.\u00c2\u00a0 Not a remake.\u00c2\u00a0 All the same actors return in modern day.\u00c2\u00a0 The make-shift family will reunite to help the Olson twins deal with their eating disorders.\u00c2\u00a0 Bob Saget, once known for being funny and one of the dirtiest stand ups prior to Full House, will now drop F bombs non stop.\u00c2\u00a0 And Dave Coulier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s catch phrase will be \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey, y\u00e2\u0080\u0099know Alanis Morrissette was totally talking about going down on me in that theater.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe me?\u00c2\u00a0 Doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sound right for TV? What if I told you the cast did the whole show in black face and it was called Tyler Perry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Full House of Payne?\u00c2\u00a0 Yep. Believe it.\u00c2\u00a0 Enjoy your 2010, guys.\nSubscribe to Gladstone's site .

                            "text": "July 24, 2013\nChris Holmes joined the Popdose writing staff only after enduring a humiliating series of hazing rituals. One day he'll write a tell-all book, and then they'll all pay. Until then, you can also catch him at his regular home, The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit , or you can follow him on Twitter .\nMost unfortunate pop culture trends from the \u201990s are dead and gone, but here are nine that live on like annoying zombies.\nThe good thing about pop culture trends is that most of them, while shitty, go away eventually. But some of them, like that nasty case of herpes you picked up your freshman year in college, never really vanish for good. They either hang around undiluted or just morph into something slightly different. Here are nine such pop culture legacies from a decade that couldn\u2019t end quickly enough if you ask me: the \u201990s.\nNote for the nitpickers: While some of these things did not necessarily begin in the 1990s, they came to prominence then. So there.\nThe Goatee\nIf you\u2019re reading this and are currently sporting a goatee, do the rest of us a favor and shave that shit off. Right now. What the pornstache was to the \u201970s or the mullet was to the \u201980s, the goatee was to the \u201990s \u2014 a grooming relic best left to those painfully unfunny VH1 retrospective clip shows. The only people who can still get away with that look are actors, athletes, and Evil Spock. So either be a man and commit to the full beard like the rest of us or be done with it.\nBeanie Babies\nNow worth DOZENS of dollars.\nTo be fair, Beanie Babies weren\u2019t the first useless item people lost their collective shit over; nor will they be the last. But with most hot toys, the secondary market explodes because the manufacturer can\u2019t keep up with demand. What made Beanie Babies especially annoying (and therefore worthy of this list) was that Ty Inc. artificially kept the supply of individual animals low by \u201cretiring\u201d them. Because God forbid they produce a few thousand more stuffed ducks to prevent a bunch of bored housewives from rioting. This kind of bullshit marketing ploy is now commonplace, to the point where every piece of junk companies pump out is instantly labeled a collector\u2019s item.\nThe absolute nadir of the Beanie Baby craze came in 1996, the first year of the McDonald\u2019s Teenie Beanie Apocalypse. People waited on line for hours and even got into fights, all for the privilege of owning a smaller version of an already useless stuffed toy.\nBut this story does have a happy ending. All those little sacks of stuffing that were treated like gold back then are now no more valuable than most other toys from the era. A recent eBay auction for 65 Teenie Beanies sold for a whopping $23.01 . Even that\u2019s a ripoff if you ask me.\nAdam Sandler\nTwice as douchetastic.\nIt\u2019s not that I think Adam Sandler lacks talent. He was pretty funny on Saturday Night Live, and I never pass up an opportunity to watch The Wedding Singer on cable. But if there\u2019s an entertainer from the \u201990s who has squeezed more out of his blatantly limited range of ability, I can\u2019t think of one. My brain cannot process the fact that the guy who I first saw as a funny but fairly forgettable bit player on the old Remote Control game show was given money by Hollywood to release a hateful piece of shit like Jack and Jill a few decades later. It\u2019s like his level of success is inversely proportional to how insultingly stupid his projects are.\nWorst of all, Adam Sandler is the sole reason Rob Schneider isn\u2019t giving handies for meth money in some dank Hollywood alley. I will never forgive him for that.\nCountry Pop\nI\u2019ll admit that I was never a huge country fan to begin with, but I can at least respect the old school. Johnny Cash, Hank Williams, Willie Nelson, and Waylon Jennings \u2014 this to me is what country music is all about. Not the homogenized, twangy pop pabulum that\u2019s come to represent the genre over the last 20-plus years. Sure, there\u2019s been a huge strain of pop music intertwined with country going all the way back to the days of Countrypolitan in the \u201950s and \u201960s. But Shania Twain, Billy Ray Cyrus, Carrie Underwood, and Taylor Swift? Are you sure Hank done it this way?\nMultiple Covers\nFour different covers of X-Men #1. Like a license to print Nerd Bucks.\nThis crap may not have started in the comic book industry, but it sure took hold in a big way there. Publishers realized that they had a hot thing on their hands and, as executives are wont to do, got greedy. Want to move a lot of product but can\u2019t be bothered with writing more stories? Just publish the same damn issue multiple times and slap a different cover on each one. Genius!\nBut it doesn\u2019t stop there, and it hasn\u2019t stopped yet. While a case could possibly be made for wanting multiple comic book covers, I can think of no good excuse for the same from esteemed publications like TV Guide or Cosmopolitan. And yet here we are.\nThree times as pointless.\nThe Death of Mass Cultural Experiences\nThis one may be a bit of a reach, but work with me. Depending on your viewpoint, the explosion of cable television, the internet, and musical choices in the \u201990s was a double-edged sword. On the one hand, people had more choices than ever before for entertainment. But the downside, as far as I\u2019m concerned anyway, is that the age of the shared cultural experience died for good.\nTake music as an example, think about it \u2014 what bands have come along since the \u201990s that have effectively taken over our mass consciousness, even if for a little while? I would argue that since Michael Jackson\u2019s heyday, or perhaps even Prince or Bruce Springsteen, you don\u2019t get acts that sell a shit ton of albums and are also impossible to ignore.\nThese days \u2014 and I\u2019m veering dangerously close to Bob Lefsetz territory, admittedly \u2014 the music market is so fragmented that very few top-selling acts actually seep into the brains of non-fans. The same goes for TV. The final episode of M*A*S*H aired in 1983 and drew 125+ million viewers, or seventy-seven percent of all American TV viewers. The only series finale from the last decade to crack the top 10 of that list was for Friends, which drew less than half the viewers and just over half the market share. And I\u2019d wager that more people remember watching the M*A*S*H finale.\nThat\u2019s not to say that we don\u2019t still have extremely popular media. But more and more, the people who enjoy a band or a book or a show are all already fans, and they\u2019re all high-fiving each other in the same little silo. I think the Harry Potter franchise did achieve that breakthrough, so perhaps I\u2019m being premature here.\nOK, back to the snark.\nCash Cow Band Reunions\nThe next time you purchase (or try to) a ticket for a so-called legacy act and then realize that you\u2019d need to sell a few pints of blood just to cover the convenience charge, thank these douchebags:\nWell at least the two d-bags in the middle.\nBy the time the Eagles hit the road for their Hell Freezes Over tour in 1994, they turned out to be the beneficiaries of a unique convergence between music and demographics. Their core fanbase, the Baby Boomers, were cruising into middle age and their prime earning years, and were more than willing to spend triple figures to relive their youth. Which would be all well and good, but it turned out that Messrs. Henley and friends had little interest in recording new music. In fact it would be 13 years before the reformed band released a proper studio album. In the meantime they went on two more massive, highly lucrative tours.\nOther bands followed suit in the following years, such as Kiss, the Who, and even the Police. Of course I\u2019m a willing accomplice to an extent, having seen Kiss twice in \u201996 and the Police in 2007, but I can tell you neither was cheap.\nCollecting As a Business Instead of a Hobby\n\u201cI\u2019ll go $5 on the Barry Bonds rookie card, but if even one corner is bent I\u2019ll break your legs.\u201d\nI remember the day I realized that comic books had stopped being fun, and it had nothing to do with finally kissing a girl. I was in one of those permanent flea markets, looking for an old issue of The Avengers\u00a0or Archie or something like that. I walked toward the counter and saw a kid, who couldn\u2019t have been more than 8 or 9 years old, haggling with the store owner over a comic like he was trying to broker a peace deal at Camp David. I put my stuff back, walked out, and never came back.\nBy the 1990s, comic books and sports cards had stopped being pieces of colorful paper for kids and adult fans to accrue and enjoy. They became commodities to be hoarded, speculated on, and dealt like shares of stock or bars of gold. You didn\u2019t dare handle one too much for fear of losing value. This is partly to blame for what turned into the comic book bubble of the early \u201990s. (For more on that, read any of the great and insightful essays by Mile High Comics founder Chuck Rozanski.)\nLikewise, baseball cards underwent a similar boom period, only to crash in the \u201990s. It\u2019s why cards that you spent a few dozen dollars on then can be had for a fraction of that now on eBay. And while that\u2019s probably as it should be, it just sucks that what was supposed to be a fun hobby turned countless kids into little Gordon Gekkos* in the process.\n*I\u2019m old and out of touch. Can someone give me a more current reference point for greed than Gordon Gekko?\nEXTREME (not the band)\nI get it. Attitude sells. It\u2019s been the case for decades. My main issue with the still-quite-pervasive trend of marketing things as \u201cextreme\u201d is that most of them just aren\u2019t. It\u2019s really just a cynical attempt by corporate executives to dupe people into believing that they have have had instant coolness imbued upon them just by consuming one mass-marketed product over another.\nTake, for example, one of the prime offenders in the realm of EXTREME marketing \u2014 Mountain Dew . Oh sorry, I meant Mtn. Dew. Here\u2019s one of their decidedly un-extreme \u00a0TV spots from the mid \u201980s.\nNot very in your face, is it? But add some screaming guitars, extreme cross-training (another fucking term I can\u2019t get enough of), and a de-mulleted tennis star, and you\u2019re ready to ditch those rednecks and DO THE DEW.\nWhile Agassi may be gone, the extreme-ness remains. And since the \u201990s it has spread like a damn virus to just about every consumer product imaginable \u2014 from jeans to snack chips to baby carrots. Yes, not even\u00a0 baby carrots \u00a0are immune to the X-Games-ification of American culture.\nSearch for:\n"

Are you high? There is only one boy worth anyone's time, and that boy is Pacey Witter, love of my high school life. If you were in love with Jack, then, well, that probably got awkward for you when he came out. And if you were in love with Dawson, then I just have no words for you. And this is coming from a fellow fivehead who cries in ugly ways.\nNo, instead, I'd like to focus our Highly Scientific Analytical Beam on the many lady loves of Pacey Witter and see how they rank. So let's get to it! Who's going to come out on top: Ms. Jacobs, Andie, Audrey, Joey . . . or you?\nThat's right, YOU, gentle reader. How do you stack up against the ladies of Dawson's Creek? I'm going to presume that you are EXACTLY LIKE ME in every way, by the way. Or else my scientific data will skew all wrong and I'll be forced to come up with some pseudoscience evopysch bullshit article to publish in Science Magazine and get everyone all worked up on the internet. So let's just pretend that you, like me, were an awkward-looking teenager who hadn't quite grown into her face yet and never could accomplish whatever the latest hairstyle was and maybe had a passing fancy for the bleached blond boys of the world. Whatever! This isn't important! We were secretly awesome, you and I. We just didn't know it yet.\nHere we go! We're going to rate the ladies on the following criteria:\n\u2022 \u00a090s fashion sense\n\u2022 \u00a0Positive influence in Pacey's life\n\u2022 \u00a0Grateful acceptance of Pacey's grand romantic gestures\nLet the Battle begin!\n90s FASHION SENSE\nMs. Jacobs: 5\nWell, you'd think that Ms Jacobs would actually have the edge over the other ladies, due to being much older and wiser. And she doesn't look so bad here:\nSure, the silk-blouse-tucked-in-brown-wrap-skirt combo isn't ideal, but it was the 90s, so that is basically the nicest thing a person could get away with wearing. BUT. HOLY JEEZ WHAT IS THIS:\nI mean, I can't even form words. And the fact that this outfit was used as a PROMO SHOT just makes me wonder how much heroin the wardrobe department of this show were consuming per week. Like, on average. Probably a lot.\nAndie: 7\nAndie's look was fairly unremarkable, but in the late 90s, home to midriff-baring baby tees and pleated-pants \"business\" suits for teens, sometimes the safest choice is also the wisest. Andie mostly stuck to cardigans and long skirts, and since I happen to be wearing a cardigan and a long skirt right now, I dig it. (and docksiders! I basically am dressed like a Dawson's Creek extra right now. I don't wanna wait! For my leg hair to grow out! I want to wax them now, why can't it beee?)\nJoey: 5\nI know what you're thinking. \"Erin, how can you rate Joey a 5 when she and Andie usually wore the same sort of thing?\" Well, first of all, I like Andie better. And second, Joey once wore this:\nAudrey: 6\nWellll, it's Busy Phillips, so. You never know what you're gonna get, really. She mostly managed to stay trendy without being totally ridiculous, but she had a reliance on screen-printed flower \"vintage-look\" tshirts that did her remarkable chest no favors. But honestly, I mostly phased out Audrey's clothes once Pacey grew that awful goatee. Actually, she should get some points knocked off for being seen with that goatee in public. Therefore, she really gets a score of 2.\nYOU: 0\nWell, I don't know about you, but I used to wear babydoll dresses WITH PATTERNED MESH OVERLAYS and would occassionally style my hair in a half-up, half-down ponytail where the Half-Up part was CURLY. Oh, and I used a 1-inch barrel curling iron on my bangs and sprayed them with Aqua Net so that they'd stay perfectly circle-shaped all day. We deserve nothing for what we have given to Pacey.\nRESISTANCE TO PACEY'S CHARM\nMs. Jacobs: 4\nMs. Jacobs actually puts up a fair amount of resistance to Pacey's charms - I mean, it takes her three whole episodes to give in and do it with him. But, considering she's his teacher, it should have taken her 40 episodes, which is approximately 2 years, at which point it's legal to sleep with your student, if still morally repugnant. So she gets points knocked off for Fitzing her way into Pacey's (beautiful) arms.\nAndie:\u00a05\nAndie actually put up a pretty good fight before she succumbed to the charms of Pacey Witter, as we all eventually do. It took quite a few earnest speeches from Pacey, plus one car accident, for her to finally see the light. Oh, Andie. I'd ask you if you were crazy but that might be awkward, given your history.\nJoey:\u00a01\nUm, it took FOREVER for Joey and Pacey to get together, and he basically had to throw everything he had at her. I mean, he rented her a WALL, for chrissakes. A wall. You know who has rented me a wall? No one. Of course, I'm not sure what I'd do with a wall, but that is neither here nor there. The point is, if someone rented a wall for me or, say, kissed me so I'd stop talking, or watched me while I sleep . . . okay, actually, that part is creepy. But the rest of it was really hot and I would have jumped on that right away! JOEY POTTER, Y USO DUMB, BB?\nAudrey:\u00a07\nAudrey is one of the few people who mutually pursued Pacey, and while she was never my favorite Pacey Paramour, there's something to be said for a girl who actually sees the potential in front of her. Well played, Busy Phillips' Face!\nYou:\u00a010\nYou score top marks in this section! After all, how long did it take you to realize that Pacey was the only guy worth swooning over on Dawson's Creek? An episode? Maybe two? Either way, your willingness to accept Pacey for the amazing fictional boyfriend that he is makes you the clear winner. Congratuwelldone!\nPOSITIVE INFLUENCE IN PACEY'S LIFE\nMs. Jacobs:\u00a00\nOh, sure, she \"makes him a man,\" but she is his TEACHER. Not only that, but Pacey totally gets a bad reputation, probably gets a beating from his dad over it, and has to talk in front of the school board about their affair, which always sucks. Plus he risks his life to help her in a hurricane. A piece of wood could have blown over and hit him in the head. He could have died. In Season One. Awful, awful thought.\nAndie:\u00a09\nAndie gets pretty high marks, since she basically reforms Pacey into a model student, allowing him to actually graduate high school on time, plus gets him to deal with some of the heavy stuff he's been carrying around in secret. It's Andie that subtly pushes Pacey to confront his dad about the drinking and the abuse and the neglect, and Andie who's there for him after he does.\nOf course, then she goes to the inpatient facility, sleeps with someone else, and basically makes Pacey's life hell for a while. So I had to knock off a point. Science demands it.\nJoey:\u00a04\nI'm sorry for saying this, and I swear it's not just cause she married Tom Cruise, but Joey just wasn't very good for Pacey. What happened to him under her romantic influence? Let's see, he sailed a boat around, which was good. He got started in the restaurant business, which was successful for him most of the time. And he fought with his best friend and went round and round with Joey endlessly because she kept dumping him. I don't know. I just think Pacey deserves better, i.e. a plane to spell out \"PACEY IS THE MOST WONDERFUL. SURRENDER DOROTHY.\"\nAudrey:\u00a00\nOh, please. Audrey gets no points for this. The GOATEE, for crying out loud. THE GOATEE.\nYou:\u00a08\nI know; I know. It's not a perfect score. We did okay; don't get me wrong. We did our very best. But is Pacey the internationally known wunderkind that he really deserves to be? When I Googled Pacey Witter Fansites, I didn't even get 10,000,000 results! Have we really done all we can do? Have we?\nGRATEFUL ACCEPTANCE OF PACEY'S ROMANTIC GESTURES\nMs. Jacobs:\u00a03\nShe fell for the candles-in-the-park gesture, but I'm not entirely sure she displayed the correct amount of gratitude for Pacey fighting a hurricane to get to her or his speech to the school board. This man has put his life and his dignity on the line for you, lady! He had to spend an evening trapped in your house with DOUG. At least acknowledge that! Or, hell, just give him one good book to turn him into a reader, jeez. What kind of English teacher are you? Oh, yeah. The kind that sleeps with her student.\nAndie:\u00a03\nIt may be the alcohol talking, but I don't actually remember many grand romantic gestures between these two. There was too much Other Stuff, like Andie dealing with her brother's death and Pacey dealing with his father's assiness and Andie going, you know, a little unhinged, for a lot of wall-renting activities. So I had to low score Andie. Sorry, Andie, ILU!\nJoey:\u00a08\nShe may talk too much and cause endless drama, but Joey definitely got the most romantic gestures from Pacey. I mean, the wall? The time he told her to go to Paris but then secretly wanted her to sail away with him? Not to mention the number of times he punched Dawson because of her, all of which I enjoyed watching, because Dawson is the kind of person who should be punched daily. Joey may have been hard to woo, but at the end of the day, she always saw the value behind, say, someone renting you a wall, and locked that shit down.\nAudrey:\u00a00\nYou:\u00a010\nYou may be wondering - what kind of romantic gestures did Pacey ever make for me? Well, other than every day of existing, that is. Perhaps you are forgetting about Pacey-Con '10, in which Pacey came to ComicCon and read Pacey fan fiction aloud and played the Dawson's Creek theme song on a boom box? That was for you. Pacey does it all for you. And you gleefully and gratefully accept it and tell him how amazing he is. On the internet. Where he won't actually ever see it. This detail doesn't matter, though. You're doing an awesome job! Keep it up!\nCONCLUSION\nMs. Jacobs:\u00a012\nAndie: 24\nJoey: 18\nAudrey: 9\nYou: 28\nCongratulations, YOU! You totally beat out all the other ladies as the greatest paramour for Pacey Witter!!! To congratulate yourself, go to Youtube and watch fan videos of Pacey and/or just stare at photos of him on the internet all day. You deserve it!!\nFYA\n"

                            "text": "Published on\nMark McGrath.\nMembers of the band Better than Ezra.\nUncle Kracker\nMark McGrath.\nLead singer Mark McGrath, 47, said the band drew inspiration from a mixed-bag of influences, from mod culture to rockabilly. It might have been a marketing guru\u2019s nightmare, but from an artistic perspective, it kept things exciting.\n\u201cSugar Ray is giant stew. If you listen to all our records, it\u2019s annoyingly so. That was a problem with our record company. They didn\u2019t know how to market us at first,\u201d McGrath said in a recent phone interview with The Blade. \u201cWe were touring with Korn and the Deftones, but we had \u2018Fly\u2019 on the radio. It was kind of a marketing nightmare, but it kept us engaged. It didn\u2019t anchor us to any certain style: We could dance in the pop markets; we could hang out in the alternative world; or we could play in the rock world as well.\u201d\nThe band reached stardom with its No. 1 single \u201cFly\u201d in 1997. The swanky song with its deliciously infectious verse I just wanna fly. Put your arms around me, baby appeared on the CD Floored twice. One version featured Jamaican-born artist Super Cat, who injected it with a reggae vibe, lifting the song up to a summertime hit.\nMembers of the band Eve 6.\nIt also didn\u2019t hurt that frontman McGrath was very easy on the eyes, with a goatee, spiky frosted blond hair tips, a chiseled jawline to match, and at times raspy voice, all of which he used to woo fans.\nToday, his hair is still spiked, although he did go through a \u201clong blond, nightmare bangs hairdo\u201d in 2003. \u201cThough my hair is getting a lot grayer, I do dye it. I\u2019m happy to just have hair. So if it\u2019s going to go spiky, or go kooky, or go nutty, I\u2019m gonna do it. And it worked for Rod Stewart for 60 years, so what the hell,\u201d he said.\nThat humorous, \u201cwhat the hell\u201d attitude, trickles into his latest musical projects, his debut solo EP Summertime\u2019s Coming and the third annual Under the Sun Tour, which brings some of those popular \u201890s earworms to Centennial Terrace at 7 p.m. Sunday.\nIf you go:\u00a0Under the Sun Tour, featuring Sugar Ray, Uncle Kracker, Better Than Ezra and Eve 6, unfolds at 7 p.m. Sunday at Centennial Terrace. Tickets may be purchased at Stranahan Theater box office, 4645 Heatherdowns Blvd., by calling 419-381-8851, or online at etix.com .\n\u201cMy whole sales pitch is: If you don\u2019t like No. 1 songs from the \u201990s please do not come to the show. That is what we have, incredible music from this decade the \u201990s. If it meant anything to you \u2014 if you bought a CD; if you remember a song; if you had a life\u2019s moment to one of these songs \u2014 you are going to have a great time,\u201d he said.\nSugar Ray originated in Southern\u00a0California in the late \u201980s. It wasn\u2019t until a decade later that it would get a taste of success with a string of top 10 hits and two No. 1 singles, \u201cFly\u201d and \u201cEvery Morning.\u201d Beginning as a \u201cpunk rock thrashy band,\u201d the songs that made them famous were likened to breezy melodies.\nMirroring the band\u2019s assorted style, McGrath\u2019s tastes span a spectrum from the Beach Boys and the Beatles, to Slayer, the Wu-tang Clan, and Bastille. The three-time VH1 Rock & Roll Jeopardy! champion credits the Sex Pistols for \u201chaving the belief, the will, and fortitude to get on stage regardless of what happens.\u201d\nMembers of the band Better than Ezra.\nThe band gained popularity during a period when beatmakers experimented beyond the mainstream genres, breaking down musical walls and opening up \u201cthe ears and minds of people.\u201d\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t one [definitive sound of the \u201990s]. That is what made the \u201990s so great. It truly was the Lollapalooza Age, when all the barriers and genres of music were broken down. It started with Lollapalooza [music festival] in the \u201990s, when you had Ice-T touring with Jane\u2019s Addiction with Nine Inch Nails, and the Pixies. Pop music should really be given a lot of credit in the \u201990s because you would literally hear DJs say this: \u2018Coming up we\u2019ve got Eminem, Mariah Carey, and Blink-182 [he recites in a stylized voice].\u2019 So you\u2019ve got R&B, punk rock, and hip hop and all in the same format being played back-to-back,\u201d he said.\nMcGrath\u2019s entertainment footprint expanded to TV and film, co-hosting Extra, putting his best business foot forward on the fourth season of The Celebrity Apprentice, and appearing in the \u201ccampy and kooky\u201d film series Sharknado 2 and recently released Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!.\nUncle Kracker\nHis first love, though, is music.\nFor his solo EP and namesake song \u201cSummertime\u2019s Coming,\u201d McGrath and guitarist Rodney Sheppard were casually writing songs and wanted to have some fun. The upbeat, bright single released on fan site PledgeMusic at pledgemusic.com/\u200bprojects/\u200bmarkmcgrath, almost makes you wonder if he has a dark side.\n\u201cOh, God, yes. Oh, totally, I\u2019m Irish, come on,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of torment in my soul. The lead singer is a lot like comedians. There\u2019s a lot of tears of a clown type thing. I just don\u2019t think anyone wants to hear darkness from me. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s organic and it\u2019s certainly not organic in our songwriting.\n\u201cWhat worked with us is our summertime vibe. When you think of Sugar Ray I hope you think of summer. It\u2019s been told to me for the last 20 years that people do, and that\u2019s a great place to be.\u201d\nContact Natalie Trusso Cafarello at: 419-206-0356, or ntrusso@theblade.com , or on Twitter\u00a0 @natalietrusso .\nClick to comment\nGuidelines: Please keep your comments smart and civil.

You're fairly middle of the road, probably pretty boring and there's a good chance you at least dabble with the acoustic guitar.\nTypical Quote: \"Kurt Cobain was just so, like, you know, wounded. Say, why don't you take off your shirt while we rap some more?\"\nExperimentation is a part of becoming a man. I mean haven't you ever wondered what it would feel like to have those coarse wiry hairs dangling all over your lips or to have that ultimate symbol of manliness spread all over your face, keeping you warm during those cold, cold nights? Yes, growing a beard is a rite of passage for every man. Wait\u2026 what did you think I was talking about? But you should all know that whenever you decide to experiment with facial hair you are making a statement to the world, whether you realize it or not. And because we care about you and what you choose to spread all over your face, we here at Guyism have decided to give you all a helping hand on your road to manhood (Not that kind of hand. Not this time, anyway\u2026) with this helpful guide, which explains what these 16 different types of facial hair say about you.\n15 Five O'Clock Shadow\nWhat This Says About You: That you think you look rugged, but you think you're too good looking to grow a full beard. You want people to think you're a man without thinking that you're Hillbilly Jim. Either that or you're just really lazy.\nTypical Quote: \"I'm thinking about waxing my chest but I want to keep a little strip. You know, just something for the ladies to admire.\"\n14 Horseshoe Mustache\n\u00a0What This Says About You: That you really, really want people to think you're a badass. You probably own a motorcycle (only a Harley, none of those commie rice rockets) and you met your wife during a bar brawl when she hit you with a bar stool.\nTypical Quote: (Sneers, stares silently, trying to intimidate you.)\n13 Chinstrap\nWhat This Says About You: That you want people to think that you're sweet, sensitive, but still tough, a wounded bad boy with soul. Also, you really, really want early-90's R&B to come back in a big way. Oh, and that you are hilariously cheesy.\nTypical Quote: \"Come on, girl, you know I do it all for love. I just wanna $ex you up, baby. I adore mi amor.\"\n12 Pencil Mustache\nWhat This Says About You: That you are kitschy as hell and you probably own a complete set of retro Buck Rogers collector cups. Oh, and that you're still a \"bachelor\" even though you're 58 years old and you live in Key West with your \"roommate,\" Ramon.\nTypical Quote: \"I prefer A Star is Born era Judy Garland to Wizard era Judy, but that's just me. I can just feel her pain.\"\n11 Van Dyke\nWhat This Says About You: That you consider yourself an artist even though the only thing artistic about you is that beret you bought from the thrift store and your heroin addict girlfriend.\nTypical Quote: \"Ugh, I find politics to be so\u2026 suburban. Let's talk about something more important, like did you hear that they're not going to run midnight showings of The House of Wax on Halloween this year? Fascists.\"\n10 Mutton Chops\nWhat This Says About You: That you want a beard without actually having to have one. Either that or you can't grow the rest. Of course, there is also the possibility that you are an Elvis impersonator or that you are in training to join the X-Men.\nTypical Quote: \"They wanted me to shave my sideburns before they'd hire me at McDonald's, but I told them no way, man. This is, like, my identity and shit. I'll just apply at Arby's. I hear they let you smoke weed out by the dumpsters when you take out the trash. That's just what I heard, man.\"\n09 The Magnum P.I.\nWhat This Says About You: That you drive around in your Corvette just so you get the chance to make eye contact with ladies -\u2013 it doesn't matter who, as long they have a vagina and are ages 18-80 -\u2013 and that you probably own at least one gold medallion, which is good because you need something to cover your chest since you refuse to button your shirt past your sternum. Oh, and you desperately wish that it was still 1981. Either that or you're a cop.\nTypical Quote: \"Why don't we go back to your place? Mine is still being fumigated for crabs. Wait\u2026 where are you going? Wait!\" Or: \"License and registration.\"\n08 Soul Patch\nWhat This Says About You: That you think that you're sensitive and a bit mysterious, but really you just look like the sort of dude who snaps at bad poetry and then breaks out his one anecdote about Gloria Steinem that he uses every time he meets a vulnerable looking woman at the bookstore. You want people to think that you're cooler than cool, more progressive than progress itself and that you really, really care, man.\nTypical Quote: \"I don't have a condom, but it's alright, we can just cuddle. Unless\u2026 you trust me, don't you?\"\n07 Goatee\nWhat This Says About You: That you're comfortable going through life looking like a billy-goat. Also, that you can't grow in the rest, but you think that this manages to hide your weak chin/six chins.\nTypical Quote: \"I prefer regular Mountain Dew to Code Red Mountain Dew even though the guys I play Call of Warfare with make fun of me for being boring. But I'm an individual, man.\"\n06 Ordinary Mustache\nWhat This Says About You: That you've basically given up on life and/or you own a white van and are not allowed within 100 yards of a public school.\nTypical Quote: \"Get in the van.\"\n05 Hitler Stache\nWhat This Says About You: That you really, really don't like the films of Steven Spielberg or Woody Allen. Either that or you're Michael Jordan. Also, you accept the fact that everyone you meet will instinctively hate you on site. Oh, and it's possible that you own a weiss van and are not allowed within 100 yards of a schule.\nTypical Quote: \"Get in ze van!\"\n04 Hobo Beard\n\u00a0What This Says About You: That you just don't give a \u00a0F.\nTypical Quote: \"I just don't give a F\"\n03 The Amish\n\u00a0What This Says About You: That you have at least two friends named Jedediah and that you are unable to read this because reading this is a sin. Also, you get your kicks drag racing your horse and buggy through a cornfield but if Pa ever finds out, he'll take away your other pair of pants and your good work shirt.\nTypical Quote: \"Thou can't catcheth my whip in the quarter mile, English. I hath two horsepower.\"\n02 Fu Manchu\nWhat This Says About You: That you are either the villain in a 70's Kung-Fu flick or you are an outrageous hipster. Either way, everyone you meet secretly wants to karate kick you in the chest through an open window.\nTypical Quote: \"douchebag\"\n01 The Stonewall Jackson\nWhat This Says About You: That you really, really love having a beard, so much that you are willing to have it be your defining characteristic. Also, you may or may not live in a shack in the woods and make a living selling moonshine and spend your days hollering at people because you think that the flu shot they got last winter really contained tiny neurotransmitters so that the government can read their thoughts.\nTypical Quote: \"If you don't get off my property, I'm gonna introduce you to my good friend Winchester J.

                            "text": "\u00a0Grooming your beard is getting more important lately because guys with a perfectly groomed beard now get head turning looks everywhere they go. If you are man who likes to have a good looking beard and still do not know which beard style looks best on you; well by the time you are done looking through this post, you will be more than sure of which style to go in for. In choosing the how to style your beard you must not only consider your face shape but also put various other issues into consideration like your hairstyle and age. For example, if you are only 20 years of age and you wearing a mustache trust me you are going to look much older than you really are. No matter which beard style you are going in for, a good regular trim accompanied with the right maintenance products( beard grooming kits ) will help to keep you looking your best. That said, let us get straight into the 20 best beard styles for men in 2016 -2017 that will make most men grab thousands of compliments.\nBeard Styles for Men with Longer Hair \u2013 Modern Beard Styles for Men\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWe have seen a lot of beard styles combined to come up with a unique and special but trust me, nothing beats the combination of a mustache paired with a goatee. If you have a round face shape, there is a way the goatee helps to bring a longer appearance and at the same time gives you that masculine look that you would like to have.\nRecommended Products from Amazon\n\u00a0\nLatest Beard styles for Men \u2013 Best Short Beard Styles for Men\n\u00a0\nWhen we talk about the latest beard styles we cannot leave out this beard combined with stubble, I simply love how it makes the guy wearing it in the image manly and all mature. I would not recommend this beard style to a guy in their 20s but if you are in your 40s and above that you will definitely rock it nicely. The style features cheeks and jawline covered up in a beard that is not so long but it longer than stubble, more like a two to three weeks beard. From just below the lower lip and down to the chin, hair is much shorter trimmed to stubble length.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOf late one of the latest beard styles is this light beard which looks more like a full beard but it is not that thick. For men that want to grow a full beard for the first time or those whose hair grows at slow pace will find easier starting with this light beard. It is stylish with hair growing out from the side, along the jawline and below the chin. Above the upper lip you will find some hair as well but the neck line is left completely clean. The number one reason as to why this beard style becomes more and more popular every other day is the fact that it can be both a formal or informal look that is to say a sportsman can confidently wear the style as well as the very busy office guy. Invest in one of the best beard trimmers to maintain the beard to perfect length. To tame your beard and make it look attractive, the Beard Balm \u2013 All Natural Easy-to-Use Leave-in Beard Conditioner \u2013 Handmade in Detroit \u2013 Original Scent will absolutely be at your service so do not be hesitant to try it out.\n\u00a0\nIn particular I love this long goatee because of the its unique length, it is very rare that you will find someone growing their goatee to this length hence making the style very outstanding. Secondly it is detailed with blonde and brown which is a very perfect shade for his white skin.\nOh and I cannot possibly forget to mention how great the dark brown hair looks on his\u00a0 skin. To make goatee styling a routine that will not take all day but one that comes up with the perfect results do not hesitate going in for the Goatee Saver \u2013 The Goatee Shaving Template. It is designed to make styling the goatee one of the easiest tasks you will ever have to do.\nCreating this goatee:\nGrow a full beard: in order to have the perfect goatee, you must first of all grow your beard into a full one so that it becomes easy for you to shape out your goatee. The mere fact that this is a long a goatee you must let your beard grow to a really long length.\nDecide which length you want: not every face shape will look good with such a long goatee, therefore I would only recommend that round and square shape faces to go in for this look. If your face shape in long such a long goatee will make your face appear even much longer.\nOutline your goatee: the outline of your goatee will depend on how you want to style your beard for example in thing image he style his goatee with a mustache so make sure to outline the goatee hand in hand with the mustache.\nCleanly shave the cheeks: use a safety razor as it will be easier for you to control so that you do not cut into your style and spoil it.\nWash your face to finish: use cold water to wash your face so as to help close skin pores and soothe the skin.\nRecommended: Beard Grooming Kits\nFrench Beard styles for Men\n\u00a0\nThe style of the French beard is designed with a mustache and large soul patch where hair runs from just below the lower lip and chains up into the goatee. The cheeks and neckline are left completely smooth and clean giving him that formal and serious guy appearance.\nAnother way in which you can wear the French beard style is without the soul patch but with a goatee and mustache. This works mainly for guys jaws that are not so curved so the squared jaws might be left out on this one.\nBest beard styles for\u00a0 Men with Round Face or Oval Face\n\u00a0\nA Stubble beard with a thin mustache beard gives a round face shape the perfect face shape reason being it does not increase how wide it appears and with some hair on the chin your face will have a longer appearance. Stubble is left along the jaws down to the neckline and some on above the upper lip. The rest of his face is shaved to allow his neat stubble to stand out and we also love how stubble is only left on a small part of the neckline. If you have a round face or oval face shape and in your 40\u2019s, I can assure you that there no way you will go wrong with this stubble beard style. Achieving the perfect stubble requires a great quality trimmer with a variety of length settings to be able to trim your beard to the most ideal length.\n\u00a0Top rated Beard Trimmers\u00a0\nHow to maintain the stubble beard style;\nKnow when to trim your beard: depending on how fast your hair grows; it is a must to trim your beard every after three to five days. I f you leave stubble without trimming it for more than five days then you will definitely not be growing stubble but a beard.\nHave the right tools: number one tool for maintaining your stubble is having a really quality trimmer with various length settings. Such a trimmer will help you to easily trim your stubble to the length you want it to.\nCreate boundaries: with stubble hair can easily go astray, therefore you need to know where lines and edges should stop. Endeavor to keep the boundaries looking very neat by cutting away stray hairs.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis is how you can get the perfect clean shave just like the one he is wearing:\nPrepare well for the process; this involves checking whether your shaver is sharp enough or if it is fully charged and if not then endeavor to charge it first.\nChoose the shave you want; if you are in a hurry the dry shave will be a perfect choice and when you have time and are scared for your sensitive skin then probably the wet shave will be more soothing.\nWash and rinse your face prior to the shaving process so that sweat and dirt coming from the skin does not clog your shaver.\nBegin shaving while tightly stretching the skin so that shave can come really close to skin but do not press the shaver too firm on to your skin.\nFinish up by rinsing the face with cold water and applying some aftershave or a moisturizer.\nBest Beard Style for Shaved Heads \u2013 Beard Styles for Bald Men\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGoing bald has nothing to do with your age, \u00a0some younger men look exquisite with \u00a0shaved heads and now we come to this older guy who still kills it on the same look. The only difference is that with this current picture is wearing an entirely \u00a0shaved head look with not even one-inch hair left. It looks good with his long face shape and when it comes to styling it will much easier and less time wasting. Once you have the shaver that can that close you will definitely be able to get yourself this awesome look. I would recommend this \u00a0beard style to any guy in his 40\u2019s or above that because it requires very little maintenance and at that age you don\u2019t need a cut that will make you spend a whole day in the mirror.\nIn addition, he is rocking a mustache which we all know is a favorite for men in his age bracket and since he has a clean shaven head and beard, I absolutely love the way anyone would easily notice his mustache even from a distance. Nothing will ever beat safety razors when it comes to giving that super close shave therefore if you are looking forward to having the cleanest and closest shave then do not think twice about trying out the Edwin Jagger DE89Lbl Lined Detail Chrome Plated Double Edge Safety Razor\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe square shaped faces tend to have very outlined jaws therefore the perfect beard style to go with a shaved head or short hair on square face will be either a clean shave or a goatee. Reason being it does not increase the width of your jaws but simply prevent them from growing out further to the sides. Such faces need beard styles with more hair around the chin and little or no hair on the jaws, in this image we just love how his square jaws stand with no hair at all. If you have \u00a0short hair\u00a0with one inch hair left then try out the clean shave, it will be a good choice for you. These beard styles could also work well with most black men.\nRound face shapes are simple the opposite of long face shapes because for them, you will need that style that makes your round face gain some length and appear longer than it is. Round face shapes appear best with beard styles that have longer hair on the chin but shorter hair on the sides. The round face shapes guy features on this image has short hair where by the sides are shorter and slightly long hair on top of the head. And moving on to his beard, it is a well groomed stubble\u00a0on the jaws that is later detailed with a thin mustache. The beard nicely angles his face enabling us to notice the perfect combination between his beard style and shaved head.\nJust like all the other face shapes we have just looked with short hair, the triangular face also stands out much more when your head is shaved. He chose to have his shaved head accompanied with very short stubble which is by the way very stylish. I would recommend this look for the white men out there who are into sports as this is a really cool sportsman look. Along the jaws we can spot some stubble but it is very thing while on the chin it is quite thick, there is also some hair just below his upper lip. A clean neck line together with clean shaven cheeks makes his style look really perfect.\n\u00a0\nStubble Beard Style for Men with Short Hair\nFor any\u00a0 man that cannot stand the hardship of waiting for the beard to grow extremely long yet at the same time would not want to completely shave it away this is a really great example that you can take from. His length of stubble is quite long and very thick making us draw a lot of attention to the white skin that he has. I love the fact that his neck line is left super clean, it simply helps us to notice how his stubble stands out. Achieving this length of stubble might not be that easy but hey, you will definitely love the results as everyone will give you lots of compliments on how you manage to keep your stubble that perfect. From the cheeks, along the jawline below the lower lip and even below the nose, all his facial hair was cut to the same look. the Wahl 9867 Lithium Ion Beard and Stubble Trimmer with its 7 position hair comb will give you the best stubble ever,because this number of length settings makes it easy for you to trim your hair to your favorite length.\nTips:\nInvest in trimmer with length settings, there is no way you can get the perfect stubble if your trimmer does not allow you to trim to a certain length.\nUse a trimmer not s shaver or if you must you use a shaver; it must have a beard trimmer attachment.\nAlways shave the neckline completely clean, stubble only looks smart with a clean shaven neck. As problematic as it may be for you to shave along the neckline; take your time to perfectly shave off all the hair.\n"

I also love what I consider \"medium\" length on men, I guess that would be anywhere in between chin and shoulder. I find I also like some shorter lengths on men too, at least a couple inches of hair... Really, the one hair length I find completely, absolutely boring and unattractive is a buzz cut.\nI also like all different levels of facial hair on men, from none to a little scruff to full beards, however I do not like standalone mustaches or huge sideburns.\nAside from guys with buzz cuts, standalone mustaches and huge sideburns, I pretty much like everything. What will do it for me is the right combination of hair length and facial hair(or lack of facial hair) and the guy in question's build and facial features. :p\nholothuroidea\nNovember 11th, 2011, 09:41 AM\nIt's all good. Long hair, short hair, bald , hairy, bearded, shaven fine thick curly wavy straight whatever. I'm just a big fan of people in general and all the varieties they come in.\nBased purely on aesthetics, my favorite is dark brown medium length curly hair. (DH has it :D) The absolute best thing, though, is to rock your own style and take good care of it. If you're not into hygiene just shave it off because bald can be cool if that's what you do (Billy Corgan, anyone? :pumpkin:)\nETA: Also, Michael Stipe.\nNovember 11th, 2011, 12:39 PM\nI think men can look good with both long and short hair.

The inbetween doesn't seem edgy enough somehow?!\nMintChocChip\nJune 18th, 2012, 03:12 PM\nI don't mind either way if it's just a guy on the street, however I do tend to go out with guys who have shorter hair.\nalexandros22\nJune 18th, 2012, 05:27 PM\nI'm a guy with long hair and I was concerned about that question too, but it turns out that women who like men with long hair are far more than men with long hair! So don't worry guys!\nOilPaint\nJune 18th, 2012, 06:11 PM\nIt does depend on the guy, some guys look great with crew cuts, but in general I love long hair on guys...  Especially thick, wavy hair.  :love:\nMy preference is actually somewhere between the long haired intellectual with the mustache and goatee (slicked hair and beard well trimmed), and of course the rugged Viggo Mortenson look from LotR. :cloud9:\nThe main thing is that they actually care about their appearance and hygiene, even if they are sporting the rugged ranger do.\nBTW - Alexandros; you are sporting one of the sexiest hairstyles for guys.  Now I just have to convince my husband to let me do that to his hair!\nNae\nJune 18th, 2012, 06:24 PM\nWell DH has short hair, and I love that.  If he had long hair.....I would love that too.  I think it is all about the wearer though lol.\nCovet\nJune 18th, 2012, 06:41 PM\nI like long hair on guys but I really think it depends on how it look with the rest of their image too, so whether I like it or not varies from person to person. It's unusual to see a man in a suit with long hair for example in comparison to a skater.  There's a guy I work with who has absolutely stunning APL brown hair, he is very beautiful. As for facial hair, I like it as long as it's short (under 1cm long).\nIvanaGil\nJune 18th, 2012, 11:46 PM\nSorry but I'm all for short hair. I'm not attracted to men with long hair at all. I like a short buzz cut :D\nMesmerise\nJune 18th, 2012, 11:59 PM\nI don't let hair length dictate whether I like a man or not BUT I must confess... there is one particular musician who I thought was GORGEOUS with short hair. And he grew it longer... and some people liked it but I did not (even though it was pretty hair)... and wanted him to cut it... and HE HAS and he LOOKS ADORABLE AGAIN!!!\nBut yet... in most men it doesn't bother me either way. Very weird!!\n(However I used to have a rule that I'd never go out with a guy who had longer hair than me :p mostly just cause I'd be jealous!!)\nmorrigan*\nJune 19th, 2012, 12:38 AM\nWhen i meet SO he had BSL blonde hair, that was really shiny, but quiet thin, last autumn he had quiet a big shed, so did i. But few months later it was very visible on him, most of his hair was about 4-5 inches long so he decided to cut his hair in style that Brad Pitt has it in Inglorious Bastards. The result is that his hair looks a lot thicker and he looks so good with short hair, also he looks taller :D\nloveisdivine\nJune 19th, 2012, 04:03 AM\nI love long hair on guys.

I like guys with both long and short hair. Just clean and tidy kept, that's my criteria ! I've seen guys with both long and short hair look horrible because they don't know how to care for it.. And for those I've seen do, I am very happy to see inside :D\nEleentje\nJune 19th, 2012, 09:24 AM\nIt really depends on the type of guy. DH has short hair, whereas BIL has long hair. I probably wouldn't like long hair on DH and short hair on BIL, because they're just the types for their current hair length.\nHope that was somewhat understandable :p\nGoblinTart\nJune 19th, 2012, 09:29 AM\nI don't have a length preference for guys. If I find a guy attractive, I will generally find him attractive whether he's buzzed or has hair to his butt.\nWhat I DO notice about a guy's hair, though, is whether it is clean or not. I can't get into a guy with dirty hair. Or just... hygiene in general.\nThis! No preference for me. As long as he takes care of himself. Of course, I'm married to a guy in the military, so he'll never have long hair. Not that he would ever grow it out anyways. I tried convincing him for a couple years before he joined to grow his hair out. He made it one month without a haircut and he couldn't stand it.\njellycatty\nLONG HAIR!

I had a boyfriend with mid-back length, big curls whose hair was gorgeous... but all the *constant* preening made him seem unattractive. The blow-frying, the product, the groaning on windy days because of the frizz... geh. I felt so unattractive next to that.\nBody hair is a bigger thing for me, because I *love* hairy chests/backs on men. I want to rub against it like a cat. It's a reflex, like men who like to motorboat women with big boobs. x.x\nMen who shave/wax ANY body hair (pits, legs, back, etc) makes me shudder. It's just not manly. Why would they do that? It's a sign of testosterone and that they are virile. I understand some dudes do it for hygiene, and I can respect that-- some guys are just stinky with too much body hair, but I could never date a guy who removed his body hair like that. It seems too high maintenance.\nWeirdly enough... I really hate facial hair. It always reminds me of my father's biker buddies from when I was growing up, and it's kinda gross to think about your dad's friends having similar facial hair when you're trying to kiss a guy.\nGlenn\nJune 22nd, 2012, 12:31 AM\nThe diversity of opinion here is fascinating, though a bit confusing, especially the extreme prejudices for a certain lenth.

Otherwise there is trouble.\nI used to prefer clean-shaven by far, but GoT has made me appreciate beards rather a lot more.\nValkyriejae\nOctober 18th, 2013, 10:34 AM\nI find it can really depend on the guy and the hair. I find shoulder-length hair on men to be super attractive if it's done right, but I mostly see it on guys who let it get greasy and don't take up care of it, which is not attractive.\nOn the other hand, it depends on the face shape too. There's a guy in one of my classes with super curly probably APL hair that looks FANTASTIC on him (and I doubt he'd look as good with short hair) but I cannot imagine my BF looking good with long hair.\nFireFromWithin\nOctober 18th, 2013, 10:54 AM\nI'm probably the wrong person to answer this because I struggle to tell if guys are attractive (I just go by what everyone else says since I'm attracted to nice guys pretty much exclusively) I think that well taken care of hair of any length looks great but I don't see all that many men with long hair. My main preference is for not having any product in it but I have to beg DBF to wait before he puts hairspray in his. I keep thinking he's going to grow it (he keeps forgetting to get it cut and then complains about the shortness when he does) and it's good to have something to hold onto and run my fingers through but we spend enough time eating my hair so I'm not sure how we'd cope with double! Beard stubble is fine as long as it's not new sharp stubble because that is scratch and it hurts my face. That's just my opinion on it all.\nRio040113\nOctober 18th, 2013, 10:59 AM\nI think it totally depends on the individual guy and what he looks best with/can pull off :) That being said I do have a preference for longish hair on men, that kind of shaggy look, anything between say, Chace Crawford* when his is longer and shoulder length (not long my male lhc members standards I'm sure haha but plenty long out here in the 'wild'!). I've never ever liked stubble, until my DBF, cannot keeps my paws off him when he's all stubbled up, which luckily for me is often ;) he just really suits it! Still not a fan of the longer style beard though, or mustaches :)\nETA - DBF has long *Chace style hair and stubble, yum! :crush:\nLeery\nOctober 18th, 2013, 11:26 AM\nI love long hair on everyone. And beards. I kind of wish I could grow one.\nRosebai21\nOctober 18th, 2013, 07:03 PM\nI like both. Just after high school, my husband could wear a ponytail. His hair was about shoulder length, and I loved it. He ironed it though, that was a little odd and made him look more feminine. He has gorgeous curls, but didn't encourage them so he ended up with major pouf hair so I understand why he did it. Then when I was pregnant with our first, about 3 years ago, his Dad convinced him to cut it off. I was livid, but it really grew on me. He has such pretty, thick black hair and it did make him look more manly and older. Plus, some of the curls came out of hiding, including one I like to call his superman curl on the hairline in front. He kept gradually getting it a little shorter and a little shorter until one day he went upstairs at my parents, and came down with pretty much a buzz cut. I didn't even know he was cutting his hair. I was cooking, and nearly threw what was in my hand at him - luckily for him I caught myself, as it was a knife! (Old habit from high school, nearly empty water bottles and other harmless things) I thought he was his brother, who lives 2,000 miles away, he really freaked me out! I still dislike it and have convinced him to grow it out at least until he gets Matt Bomer (sp?) from White Collar style. Yay! :)\nAs for body hair, I've always been a fan of only a little. But my husband's gradually getting hairy, and I like it. Amusingly, his body is \"weaning\" me into a hairy man. For facial hair, please only grow if you can have a nice, full one. I hate when my husband has any, his beard is horribly patchy. Also filling in, men in his family get a full beard about 3 years older than he is now. One of his brothers has a neard (neck beard), and that's just gross to me. If only your neck, not your body or face, that's hairy, just shave it and wait for the rest of the hair to come in!\nSnena\nOctober 22nd, 2013, 11:44 AM\nI'm jealous of guys who have long hair, so I prefer short hair on guys. Facial and body hair is appreciated... :crush:\nAlmendra\nOctober 22nd, 2013, 12:42 PM\nI prefer long hair in men. When I first met my boyfriend, he used to have a very very short hair. A few months later I saw picture of him with \"long hair\" (shoulder length) and I really liked it, his hair was so beautiful. So I convinced him to let it grow. Now his hair is APL length, but not so shiny and beautiful like in that time. But anyway, I prefer him with long hair... but I wouldn't like if it is longer than mine :P\nTrapperCreekD\nOctober 24th, 2013, 06:16 PM\n*considers list of actor and musical crushes*  Yeah, I  definitely have a thing for long hair. :crush:  It's obviously not a deciding factor but it's one of the first things I notice.  In reality, if I like you, it doesn't *really* matter if your hair is a buzz cut or down to your ankles, but since we're talking aesthetics here...\nI love anything from ear length and brushing/curling over the collar to APL-ish - no offense to any guys growing their to LHC lengths.  Add some stubble or a light beard over a strong jawline... :eyebrows:\nMy BF has short hair; he keeps it super short to hide the fact that he's prematurely going thin.  Short hair suits him, I don't think long hair would really work with his face structure.  If he ever let it grow out a few inches I think he might be a wavy.\nThis is one of my favorite cuts on a guy.  :inlove:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/NW4XkM2.png\nBun15\nDepends on the man.\nShieldMayden\nOctober 30th, 2013, 10:03 PM\nI prefer men with long hair, if it's the right type of man. The 'lord-of-the-rings-type', not the 'business-man' type.\nBut I wouldn't not like a man just because he has short hair. I find long hair more attractive, but it isn't exactly the most important quality of a person.\nAGREED 100% on the \"Lord of the Rings type\". It's been a good dozen years since Fellowship of the Ring has been released and Aragorn is still my ideal of sexy as far as a man's hair is concerned.

He started growing it out two years ago (I think he did it for me, knowing how I gawk at long haired men) and now it is to his mid back.  It looks great, healthy and with his rugged facial hair, it's super hot.  :o\nAmyBeth\nI've always been sweet on long hair on men.\nemilylightning\nNovember 2nd, 2013, 08:28 PM\nAlthough I don't consider myself a woman [gender confused] I'm going to throw in my 2 cents anyway :p\nI love long hair on men that can pull it off.

Maybe he wants to be an old hippie someday ;)\nkmcg\nNovember 9th, 2013, 05:25 PM\nDepends on the guy. Some guys cannot pull it off especially depending on their hair type. And other guys look ridiculously hunky with long hair. Facial hair is kinda the same thing.  I will say no to neck beards and soul patches that exist with out mustaches or goatees. shudder:\nAnd then there are the guys who sport the mustache only and somehow manage to make it look like a molestache (mustache fail).\nprettyinpink\nLong hair!!!\nLong hair!! Definitely.\nI agree with kmcg - it really depends on the guy!\nAlso, my tastes have really changed with time.. I used to REALLY like a guy with long hair, now I prefer short unless I feel like it really suits him. Most long-haired men I have known also really don't know how to take care of their hair, so that doesn't help either!

However that being said a pretty Goth boy with dramatic long hair, or a African American with long black braids or a handsome man in elf costume with long flowing locks...um um ummm I can not deny I like long hair on men, perhaps that is why most of the characters I most want a dance with in fantasy, science fiction or horror, men or women (yes I am bisexual) have long hair, I just like the look and feel of long hair both on myself or others, off course that do not mean everyone look good with long hair and that none look good with short hair, it is just I like how dramatic long hair look on men.\nValorie\nDecember 8th, 2013, 06:23 PM\nPreference is for long, at least not short...but the reality is short. :)\nbiogirl87\nDecember 8th, 2013, 11:02 PM\nIn real life I definitely prefer short hair on guys and men in general. On LHC, I do not really have much of an opinion since I feel if the gentlemen here want to have long hair, then that is their choice (even though I do not necessarily agree with it). When I see a guy with long hair (to me long hair on a guy is anything below about mid neck) in real life, to me it is the same as long hair the length of the hair to the floor length and a 25-foot train of hair behind it (hair the length of the dress Princess Diana wore for her wedding with the train included in the length of the dress) on a woman. The point I am trying to make is that I feel guys should have short hair (no offense to the gentlemen on LHC, if you want to have long hair, that is your choice) and when it gets to be below mid-neck, it needs to be trimmed on guys. Part of this though is that I spent part of my childhood in Ukraine and while we lived there I never really saw many guys with long hair (there were some, but they were few and far between) and in general was growing up with the idea that men were not meant to have long hair just as women (in my mind) were not meant to have pixie haircuts (although I can appreciate pixie haircuts when they look good even though I am not a fan of them).\nBlueGold\nDecember 12th, 2013, 09:43 PM\nIt really depends on the guy but I love DB's buzz cut with scruffies on his face(:\nSymphony\nDecember 13th, 2013, 03:45 AM\nI think all sorts of hairstyles suit all sorts of men, but I do absolutely adore a long, thick, glorious mane on a man.\nStray_mind\nDecember 13th, 2013, 04:11 AM\nIt depends. Some guys just don't look good with long hair, some don't in short... I prefer longer hair though, but most important is for the hair to look healthy and clean.\nHintOfMint\nSorry to say, I prefer short hair on men.\nIt's basically because I prefer my men in general to look like Republicans (but not be one!)\nLooking at my old answer from over a year ago, and holy shnikes is my answer different now. I chalk it up to falling wildly for a hippie-looking dude with long dreadlocks about two months after I made that post. Oof, he was handsome. *Fans self* Of course, he was a libertarian, so I broke my political type as well. Hard.\nMy answer now is basically that I like good looking men. If a good looking man has long hair, no hair, Fox News wardrobe, or anarchist in flip flops, whatever, he's still hot and no hairstyle can change that. Bone structure trumps all.\nHowever, I've always loved beards and body hair on men. That has been a consistent preference of mine since high school. There's something vain and un-virile about shaved bodies and baby smooth faces (in my own opinion when I'm thinking about what's attractive to ME). I remember one of my boyfriends in college had the cutest beard in the world and I was just so happy to be dating him. When he shaved it, I knew that was when he fell out of love with me. :(\ndreamingstar\nDecember 14th, 2013, 08:47 PM\nI like long hair on men - if it's well taken care of. As for facial hair, I don't like Duck Dynasty-esque beards at all, but a little facial hair is good in my book.\nSharysa\nDecember 20th, 2013, 12:06 AM\nI prefer any kind of hair, although for me it takes a specific type of face/head to pull off the military/buzzed/shaved look and look attractive as opposed to imposing/authoritative.\nI'm also beginning to suspect that I have a thing for the scene/punk crowd solely because they have awesome hair. :cool:\nAs for hair length that doesn't involve mohawks or scene/punk/emo cuts, at least shoulder-length and well-kept would be have to stand out for me. Also, healthy and well-kept curly hair on a guy will instantly turn me into a fan, like Loras Tyrell from Game of Thrones and Darren Criss of Glee and A Very Potter Musical fame.\nFor some reason it's really rare in my neck of the woods for guys with curly hair to not have it get frizzy or stringy--maybe because most guys tend to not know how to take care of their hair?\nDecemberrose\nOurAtronach\nDecember 27th, 2013, 02:23 PM\nThis morning my brother asked whether or not he should cut his shoulder length hair :o I told him to keep growing if it wasn't bothering any aspect of his life.

I've met some very attractive guys with very attractive long hair, some very attractive guys with really nice short hair, and some guys that would have been very attractive to me if their hair were longer or shorter because it would suit them better. It's really a case by case basis on what I prefer, though I tend to like hair that is longer than a buzz. Some people look better with long or short hair and some look fine whatever length their hair. I find groomed men more attractive too, facial hair is fine but it needs to be cleaned and trimmed, I know a man who would look very nice if he didn't have long, unkempt hair and a matching beard.\nAderyn\nMarch 6th, 2014, 04:56 PM\nI have a preference for shorter hair and a bit of a beard. At the same time, hair length and facial hair isn't really that big of a deal to me when dating, wouldn't have a problem being with a man who has longer hair and/or no facial hair.\nIf Aragorn were to show up on my doorstep I most certainly wouldn't say, \"Off with you, your hair is too long!\" :p\nWeewah\nMarch 6th, 2014, 05:44 PM\nI don't prefer one over the other,  but I did like that my boyfriend has long hair,  because when I was growing up in the 90s all the TV hunks had long hair!\nI need him to tie it back when we do it though,  because if he doesn't it gets all in our faces, which I don't like.\nrowan fire\nMarch 6th, 2014, 09:21 PM\nIt's 20 years later and I can still remember the boy I had this super huge crush on in high school. He had the most amazing hair. It was a lovely chestnut color and so thick and shiny with a bit of natural wave. It was down to about his jaw. He used to tuck it behind his ears. You have no idea how many times I wanted to reach out and tuck it behind when we were in class and I noticed it had fallen out.\nI thought it was just perfect. It was just long enough to separate him out from the rest, but not tooooo long which I generally don't like on a guy... except Brad Pitt as Louis in Interview With The Vampire (even though it wasn't real, it (and he) was pretty to look at :)\nLindainCO\nMarch 6th, 2014, 10:32 PM\nIt depends on the guy.\nIn the 60s, 70s I preferred long hair.

I just love it in general, on anyone. If I'm going to find a man attractive then it'll happen whether he has short or long hair, but long hair is one of those visual cues that makes me take a second look. Facial hair I have no preference over clean shaven, stubble or a short beard, but I don't like long beards. Hairless or a yeti and anything inbetween is fine for body hair.\nThose are just my personal preferences though. They're going to vary greatly from woman to woman.\ncherrybird\nMarch 25th, 2014, 06:03 PM\nGenerally I like men with short hair but I know a couple that can really pull off long hair and beard.

I got really exited when the guy I'm seeing mentioned, that he might grow a \"viking beard\" :D If he really do that, and we're are still dating, he must cope with me doing little braids on his beard ;) And putting beads and stuff.\nIn other body hair I really have not much to say. Total hairlessness would be bit creepy, but so would be if the man had enormous amount of body hair. But I don't think either would be reason not to date someone, if the guy was otherwise ok.\ndivinedobbie\nApril 28th, 2014, 12:15 AM\nI like short hair on a guy.

There are plenty of threads I don't like on this forum, but I don't dive into them and start talking about how offensive I find them, and I certainly don't try to shame people for having certain opinions.\nKina\nI don't think that means what you think it means\ndefinition of sexism (http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sexism)\nI think you mean attraction (http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/attraction), which is subjective (http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/subjective?s=t). Because it's subjective, it's up to the individual person's sensibilities whether they find someone attractive or not, which is certainly not sexist.\nEven the posts that described men (which I have not seen, or support) stating that they are unclean, isn't sexist, although it is offensive. It's a subjective statement of opinion.\nYour analogy is defective because you are using the wrong words to illustrate how offended you are. Because we're on a discussion board, where the only way to communicate is through the written word, people are responding to your words and not how you'd like them to respond (from the way it reads).\nYou're not going to get agreement on your statement, because the wording is incorrect. Had you written:\n\"I'm offended because of the way people expressed distaste of men with long hair\" then the readers would have most likely rushed in to say how terrible those statements are, which would then in turn support your argument that it's offensive because of xyz.\nQuasiquixotic\nMay 4th, 2015, 09:08 AM\nI think Boobs are beautiful on women, but not men.

My DH once grew his hair long enough for a pony tail just to see if he could do it. But he didn't like it and neither did I. But if he had liked it, I would have supported him in his hair journey. He certainly supports me in mine.\nWith beards, it also depends on the guy. I pretty much love beards. I love the softness and all of my significant boyfriends (and DH too) have had beards. But there was one guy who had the most handsome face. I met him without a beard. Then he grew one and it covered his amazingly handsome face (is this sexist?).

Clearly he's getting something out of it. :shrug:\nI don't think that means what you think it means\ndefinition of sexism (http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sexism)\nI think you mean attraction (http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/attraction), which is subjective (http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/subjective?s=t). Because it's subjective, it's up to the individual person's sensibilities whether they find someone attractive or not, which is certainly not sexist.\nEven the posts that described men (which I have not seen, or support) stating that they are unclean, isn't sexist, although it is offensive. It's a subjective statement of opinion.\nYour analogy is defective because you are using the wrong words to illustrate how offended you are. Because we're on a discussion board, where the only way to communicate is through the written word, people are responding to your words and not how you'd like them to respond (from the way it reads).\nYou're not going to get agreement on your statement, because the wording is incorrect. Had you written:\n\"I'm offended because of the way people expressed distaste of men with long hair\" then the readers would have most likely rushed in to say how terrible those statements are, which would then in turn support your argument that it's offensive because of xyz.\nWell said Kina\nI think Boobs are beautiful on women, but not men. Apparently I'm sexist.\n:rollin: Well I'm clearly a sexist too cause I'm not a fan of man boobs either. :rollin:\nKittyBird\n:scissors:\nExactly!!! I don't know what is up with this guy but you know the old saying \" If you can't handle the heat the get out of the kitchen.\" If this forum is so bad then why come back and post? Clearly he's getting something out of it. :shrug:\nWhat a funny coincidence, that's what written on my coffee mug this morning! I made ex-dbf buy it for my birthday several years ago, though he didn't really want to because he thought the text was sexist :p\nhennalonghair\nMay 4th, 2015, 11:47 PM\nI like long hair that's kept well and is healthy from root to tip whether that is on men or women. I also think men who are secure enough in their masculinity to wear their hair up in 'man buns ' is sexy as ever. Plus there's an element of mystery to it. It leaves me wondering how long their hair is, how thick it is, what texture they have and what their hemlne looks like . I feel the same way about women's hair.\nMy man however is going bald so long hair on him would just accentuate his receding hairline. Plus he's ex military so is used to buzz cuts :lol:\nYes imagine if ALL women just preferred men with long thick hair. The worlds population would be in serious jeopardy.\nUnicorn\nWhat a strange turn this thread has taken, it's hilarious.\nTheMaleRapunzel, surely it's a good thing that different people are attracted to different looks?  People can't help what they find attractive, which is the topic of the thread.  The vast majority have also indicated that their theoretical \"attractive\" look has little or no bearing on the person they will or have chosen as a partner/date, as the person is far more important than the hair.  I would think this takes it out of the sexist arena.\nSomething to consider, LHC isn't a dating site hence flirting or sexualising of members/hair is strongly discouraged (people have been banned for stepping over the line).  Perhaps this is part of the reason people felt free to give honest opinions as it wouldn't be regarded as being directed to individuals on the board or what they choose to do with their hair.\nThere's a fair number of men on the board with amazing long and super long hair.  You can chose to trawl through the thousands of threads, dragging up year old threads to be offended by or you could just continue growing your hair if you wish, while enjoying the abundance of support and information that you'll find here.\nThe second option sounds best to me.\nUnicorn\nlunasea\nMay 5th, 2015, 10:19 AM\nAt the risk of going off topic; Unicorn!  Your hair!  Sooo beautiful!\nUnicorn\nUnicorn\nAleahcim\nMay 5th, 2015, 11:45 AM\nAlthough, of course everyone is attracted to different things and there is nothing wrong with that, and I don't think anyone should be shamed or censored for expressing their opinions as long as it is done in a respectful manner.\nI've never read through the bulk of this thread, and I don't plan on it, but if it was true that people called men with long hair 'dirty' or anything along those lines, I really do find that offensive and out of line.\nAttempting to police respectful opinions or attractions is also out of line.\nI guess since I've commented, I may as well actual say my opinion as that was the purpose for this thread.\nSome men look great with long hair, some men look great with short. I think it's more about if the hair looks well cared for and the man's confidence.\nBeards on the other hand, I do have strong reactions too. While they can look great, and i can appreciate how they look. I could never be in a relationship with a man with a beard, at least not currently. This has more to do with the fact that I have been sexual assaulted by a man who had a beard and the idea of kissing a man with one makes my skin crawl and relive that experience. I am sure this is understandable.\nI'm currently in a relationship with a man in the military, so lucky for me he is clean shaven and his hair kept short. Although I have to admit it is my favourite when he is due for a hair cut, I love big able to play with his hair and love the feel of it, but he is very handsome right after he gets his hair cut as well.\nIf he was ever had the opportunity and desire to grow\nhis hair it would not matter much to me, and I would support him with that as he supports me in my desire to grow my hair longer.\ncat11\nMay 5th, 2015, 12:00 PM\nstop being butthurt, themalerapunzel.  not everyone is gonna like everything about your body and thats not sexist.  Alot of guys dont like my hair im sure, or didnt like it when it was short.  Thats not sexist\nthat said, I LOVE long hair on guys and my BF has BSL hair :D\nKina\nMay 5th, 2015, 12:03 PM\nwell, again, even the term \"long\" hair is open to interpretation. I like men.\nNo qualifiers. Of course, i dislike abusive, badly behaved men, but most men don't fall in that category. I've never been in a relationship with a man who had hair longer than shoulder length, but if I've either dated or been in a relationship with a man, it had way more to do with how *they* saw themselves, their self confidence in how they look and how they present themselves. I *do* have a *type* which is perfectly ok, although I've gone out of that type as well for the right person. My DH who passed away was COMPLETELY out of my type and comfort zone, but I gave it a shot: he was my light.\nBelle Paix\nMay 5th, 2015, 02:13 PM\nHa! Ignoring the politics of this thread (*wink*wink*), I will say in general that I've never been a big fan of long hair on guys.\nHowever, my beau has blond hair that's beyond SL, and these gorgeous cheekbones....Needless to say, I'm now a big fan of him in long hair :).\nWinterwitch\nMay 5th, 2015, 02:28 PM\nNothing is a bigger dealbreaker than bad hair for me. I won't date men with short hair. I hate it. It must be at least as long as mine (13\"/collar bone length) maybe shorter if it's coiled hair would be fine. Stringy and/or very damaged hair is a huge turn off for me as well.\nI guess I'm shallow because I have such an extreme preference? At least that's what a man told me after I told him why I turned him down. Ah well, rather be shallow than miserable on a date with someone who I don't find attractive. We like what we like! <:\nAZDesertRose\nIt depends on the person, really.\nFor example, my niece wears her hair in a pixie cut that is absolutely freaking adorable on her.  If we were to trade hair (her pixie on me and my APL mess on her), we'd both look silly, I think.  I know I'd look ridiculous with a pixie cut because I tried it when I was around her age (she's 17), and my thick semi-wavy longish hair would overwhelm her face because she's got delicate facial features (probably from her mom, because my brother [niece's dad] is strong-featured like I am).  My facial features are very bold, and I just look silly with short hair.\nWith regard to the fellas, I've known men who looked good with short hair but silly with long hair, men who looked fantastic with long hair but silly with short hair, and men who could pull off either long or short hair (and had done so at various points in their lives).\nI think as long as you take good care of your hair (keep it clean and groomed), you should do with your hair what makes you happy.  I grow mine long because I like it long, I like playing with my hair toys, and I look silly with hair much shorter than shoulder length.\nRapunzel_to_be\nMay 5th, 2015, 03:02 PM\nIt depends on the person for me too, I do not like it when guys have too much products, like gel in their hair though.. but the length really depends on the guy, although I think I prefer it on the shorter side for men than long.\nAs for facial hair, I think having a 3 day beard is the hottest.. and a lot of beard can only be worn by some, I do not appreciate this trend where all guys suddenly have a lot of beard... don't feel like they can all pull it off..\nBody hair... I don't really like body hair, and by that I mean chest and back.. although a little is ok ( on the chest, but zero on the back), the rest of the body I couldn't care less about when it comes to hair !\nBUT all of this is just superficial, and the guy I currently like is the opposite of everything I just wrote and I think he is super hot! :)\nSarahlabyrinth\nMay 5th, 2015, 03:26 PM\nTo be honest, my SO is in my life not because of his (short) hair, but because of his character and disposition. Appearance is such a secondary thing anyway.\nBrightEyes\nMay 5th, 2015, 03:49 PM\nIt really depends on the man. I normally prefer short hair. But if a man has healthy hair with wave or curl to it (especially if it's dark), I LOVE it when it is a little longer. Like collar length, but not longer than their shoulders. I adore that look. When I see a guy with that kind of hair I'm always tempted to play with it.\nBut really, personality trumps looks any day. Like has been said, physical traits are secondary.\nBrightEyes\nGah! Double post.\nMay 5th, 2015, 04:10 PM\nMy \"type\" is long-haired. My spouse prefers to keep his quite short. Ones \"type\" can be a combination of local custom and personal experience and as such can be very difficult to tease apart. It can reflect social norms (which may express sexism), but doesn't have to.\nPartners of any gender have no place demanding compliance to preference. No one is here to decorate our world. Both my grandmother asking me if I'd received my husband's permission to cut my hair short and the hairdresser asking my husband if he had my permission to get a #2 buzz cut* are inappropriate.\n*true stories, both. My husband likes to keep his hair short, but is terribly lazy about getting it cut, so hairdressers are always shocked when he tells them how short to go. They generally say something along the lines of \"have you ever had it that short before?\" but the \"wife's permission\" one made us both laugh. Apparently men are supposed to have \"short\" cuts but not nearly bald.\nmissblueeyes\nMay 5th, 2015, 04:46 PM\nTo be honest, my SO is in my life not because of his (short) hair, but because of his character and disposition. Appearance is such a secondary thing anyway.\nThis! Although I personally have a thing for long haired men in fiction, it's not a trait that's a must for my long-term partner. Heck, I couldn't care less whether he shaves it off or grows it long as long as he is happy with it and keeps it in shape. :)\nfiabia\nMay 5th, 2015, 05:47 PM\nI like long-ish hair on men, like chin-length, and a bit of facial hair!\nAlun\nMay 5th, 2015, 07:53 PM\nI am going to have long hair regardless of whether anyone likes it or not. It is inevitable that, since long hair is 'traditional' for women and short hair is seen as the norm for men, some women who want long hair for themselves will dislike it on guys, because frankly some people's views are stereotypical. OTOH, there are plenty of people who don't think that way, including enough women to go around, so why worry?\nelsieivy\nMay 5th, 2015, 07:55 PM\nMy favorite length of hair on guys is between chin and shoulder length (although long flowing Legolas hair is pretty cool too.).  But really I don't consider any hair length or type a deal breaker.  My husband keeps his hair very short and that's fine.  I know saying \"it's only hair\" sounds silly on a hair related board but it really isn't high on the list of qualities I  care about in a partner.\njeanniet\nMay 5th, 2015, 08:29 PM\nFunny thing, my dad was raised Sikh (in India) and cut his hair when he was around 23.  He absolutely abhorred long hair on men (other than Sikhs, where it was all nicely wrapped up), and was really pretty judgmental about it.\nBased on posting history, I suspect that the anger over hair length preferences stems from the cultural disapproval TMR feels.  I think it's misguided and misdirected, but I understand that it must be difficult to want long hair in a culture that rejects it.\nBTW, I took a quick look through several pages of that poll thread, and from what I could see, a lot more posters disliked short hair than long, and some of them quite vehemently.\nDreamSheep\nMay 5th, 2015, 08:56 PM\nI like hair that is longish (shag-length?), not a fan of super short, and haven't seen many long manes in real life on men that have made me go \"wow!\" (this forum is another story :p).\nI also quite like a bit of a fringe on a man, and that usually doesn't go with longer hair.\nAlthough male and female hairs are the same - or at least, there is no way of telling them apart, generally men do have thinner heads of hair than women (with many exceptions) - mainly due to potential balding (and I know not everyone balds), which I'm not going to say is incompatible with long hair - but I think puts most men off from growing it past a certain length and will certainly evoke some images of that person we know with very unkempt hair.\nThat said, to the person who mentioned the topic of sexism - would like to remind that sexism is defined as: \"Sexism or gender discrimination is prejudice or discrimination based on a person's sex or gender\", and a preference is not sexism. Also, this topic is a call for opinions, and honest ones, so it would be biased if we were to keep any disagreeing opinions to ourselves (not to mention that not everyone here has or desires long hair anyway :) ).\nThe motto of this forum is essentially, \"No one is here to decorate your world\" - thus, we all grow our hair for ourselves mainly - not to attract the opposite sex or to fulfill a gender role. In doing so, I think we also accept that there will be people out there who will dislike our hair (several of my exes really liked short hair on girls, which is what I had at the time, and don't like my long hair now) - whatever length it is.\nThat said, I'm pretty sure it applies to most of us, at least past a certain level of maturity, that the other person's personality comes first and looks are secondary. I wish my boyfriend had slightly longer hair and try to convince him not to cut it  -  but in the end he will wear his hair as he prefers, and I will still love him for who he is - in the same way I would hope he would stay with me if I cut my hair (though he did joke that he would break up with me if I did - I really hope not! >:-( )\nmissblueeyes\nMay 6th, 2015, 02:55 AM\nThat said, I'm pretty sure it applies to most of us, at least past a certain level of maturity, that the other person's personality comes first and looks are secondary.

I knew Jason Priestley had been bearded off and on but it is great to see the pics side by side like that. I think he can really pull off various styles. I saw some pictures of him in a local magazine here sporting the full beard (like the latter pics) but he had shaped it more and trimmed a proper neckline. With those adjustments it really looked much more suited to him.\nWe live as though the world was what it should be, to show it what it can be. - Angel (Season Four)\nMore\nMore\n"

                            "text": "The Today Show anchors 'promise to shave' their beards on live TV - but end up with a mustache, goatee and shorter beard instead\nThe morning show anchors did not shave for the month of November\nEach supported a different cancer charity\nBarbers were brought in to shave the beards off on Monday's show\u00a0\nAl Roker and Carson Daly went with goatees and Willie Geist got a mustache, but Roker was the only one to like his look\nMatt Lauer decided to just have a trim and stick with the beard\nThe men of the Today Show had their beards shaped live on air this morning to mark the end of their month-long charity challenge- but none of them had them fully shaved off.\nThe hosts of the morning talk show program took part in the national 'No Shave November' campaign where men across America tossed out their razors for the month in an effort to raise money for various charities that support men's health.\n'We didn't just do this to look terrible, we did this to raise money,' Matt Lauer said\u00a0 Monday's show .\nLauer didn't really think he looked terrible, however, as he announced that he would be keeping it for the winter.\nWATCH THE VIDEO HERE\nThe big reveal: Viewers suggested which looks the anchors should try out, and while a couple of them were game, Lauer decided that he wanted to keep his beard\nSpot the difference: Lauer decided that he just wanted the barber to give him a close trim and not actually shave the beard (before at left and after at right)\nTo mark the end of November, razor producer Gillette arranged for four top barbers to come in to shave the hosts and viewers were able to weigh in on styling options- choosing between a goatee, mustache, mutton chops or a chin curtain.\nAl Roker said that he would try out the goatee that was suggested for him, but Lauer announced he would be disregarding the same suggestion completely and opting to just have the barbers trim the beard and allow him to keep it for the winter.\n'My dad wore a goatee in the last few years of his life and he always looked good,' Roker said.\nRELATED ARTICLES\nShare\nWillie Geist, who had the most trouble growing a full-fledged beard, initially said he would sport the suggested mustache for a few hours before shaving it off completely.\nThat cut off may come quicker as he did not take to the mustache- and knew that his wife would not either.\n'I cannot go home with this,' he said.\n'I'm going to transition into a different form of media, the adult form,' saying how he thought he looked like a porn star.\nHe's not a fan: Willie Geist (before at left and after at right) said that he looked like he was a part of the 'adult entertainment' industry and immediately knew that he would have to shave it off before going home to his wife\nCarson Daly, who was joining remotely from Los Angeles, said he would do the same for the suggested goatee.\nDaly clearly had the fullest beard of the bunch, as Lauer joked earlier that it took him only seven hours to grow it completely.\nNot everyone loved the beards as internet commentors took the anchors to task during the Thanksgiving Day parades, saying that Lauer and Roker looked like they were homeless hobos.\n\u2018Somebody do something! A homeless man got hold of a microphone and is covering the parade! Oh no. Wait. It's just Al Roker. Oh,\u2019 wrote @brettfaultless.\nWhile No-Shave November, or Movember, initially began as a way to raise money and awareness for prostate cancer, but the Today Show embraced a larger concept for the challenge with each of the hosts picking a different charity to support.\nEmbracing it: Roker said that his kids likened him to 'Black Santa' with the full beard (left) but decided to stick with the goatee (right) like his father had for a few years before his death\nLauer stuck with the Prostate Cancer Foundation, Roker chose the American Cancer Society, Geist chose the American Heart and Stroke Association and Daly chose the Breast Cancer Research Foundation as his mother has survived the disease that also targets men. Gillette donated $100,000 to the cause, splitting it among the four charities.\nWhile Lauer didn't actually shave off the beard Monday morning, he did take part in the on-air prostate screenings that were held one week into the challenge.\nHe and Roker went to Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan, where Dr. David Samadi, a urologist, carried out a rectal exam on each of the men in an examination room off-screen.\nNatural: Carson Daly, who was in his LA radio station at the time, said he had no trouble growing a full beard\nPlayful: Daly joked around with his new look but said that his 'dream is to play for the Yankees' so he would have to shave to be a member of clean-shaven team\nThe Today Show has a history of giving out on-air exams, starting with former anchor Katie Couric who underwent a colonoscopy live on the show in 2000 following her husband's death from colon cancer two years earlier.\nWhile Couric and both of the male co-hosts were given clean bills of health, one of their counterparts over at ABC discovered she has breast cancer after having an on-air mammogram.\nAmy Robach is now undergoing treatment for the disease and is scheduled to return to work at Good Morning America today.\nRead more:\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\nMore top stories\nSome-thong to smile about!

This time the shoes will not have classic \u201823\u2019 embroidery on its heel but it will have \u201845\u2019 and there is the reason behind stitching \u201845\u2019 on the back heel. The reason is that Michael Jordan was seen wearing Space Jam Jordan for the first time on the court when he returned to the NBA from the retirement in 1995 and he decided to put on the number 45 and not his previous number 23.\nSo finally, after 20 years the Space Jam Jordan will be seen having the original makeover by getting the identical looks to what Michael Jordan wore during his 1995 NBA Playoffs which had all black mesh and a higher cut patent upper leather.\nThe other features of the Jordan 11 Space Jams include the royal blue Concord Jumpman logo inscribed on the heel tab, Nike Air branding insole, White midsole, and a translucent outsole.

Allow the two to connected to each other. Then, terminate part of the sideburns by drawing an imaginary vertical line defined at each corner of the mouth.\nExtended goatee\nA simple goatee can be one of the most interesting men's facial beards for fall, but an extended goatee can help you take everything to the next level.\nHow to:\u00a0\nStep # 1\nThe best way to start your goatee is grow a somewhat fuller beard, about one week\u00b4s growth, and then when your facial hair is nice and thick, you can work on shaping your goatee.\nStep # 2\nRun the comb through the beard, so that there are no curled hair. Now, attach a comb of your desired length to your trimmer and trim your beard to give you an even cut.\nStep # 3\nThis step is very important since it is about deciding on the outline of your goatee. I usually follow the angle of my mustache which tells me how wide I should keep the goatee on my chin.\nIf you choose to have a goatee without mustache, then you are free to make the outline as it suits you.\nStep # 4\nNow we will start defining the outline of the goatee. In order to this, we can use the our timmer without the guard or any normal razor.\nStart from your neck by making small cuts, the size of the trimmer width, to get an idea of how your goatee will take shape. I would suggest the outline on the neck to be about an inch above the adam\u00b4s apple or if you are not too sure where you want your goatee to start, make it a bit lower. It\u00b4s always easier to take more off, if need be.\nStep # 5\nRepeat the same on your cheeks, using your trimmer . Now, you can clearly see the outline on the neck as well as on your cheeks. If you are happy with the results, move on to the next step.\nIf you feel you want to make it narrower on the chin, make another outline a bit more inwards.\nStep # 6\nBy this stage, you have your outline sorted, so it\u00b4s time to shave the area of your skin which is to remain clean shaven. In my learning days, I would use some shaving cream to prepare my skin for shaving but I soon realized that it\u00b4s far better to use a clear shaving gel, so that I can see the edge of my goatee when I am getting close to my hair line.\nA very important piece of advice is that when you are shaving close to the definition line of your goatee, never shave inwards towards the goatee. You skin is soft and slippery at this stage and the razor can easily cut more than what you would have wanted to. I always put the razor on the border line and shave away from the line.\nThe above point becomes even more important if you are using an open comb safety razor as these razor tend to be more aggressive and you may end up going too far if done in a hurry.\nIf I shave the neck, I move the razor vertically downwards and if I shave the chin area, I shave away towards my ears. Can\u00b4t tell you how many times I have ended up with a weird looking goatee due to a simple slip of razor resulting in cutting too much on one side.\nStep # 7\nMake sure that you occasionally step away from the mirror and check your trim from a distance as well as close up.\nStep # 8\nThis step is very obvious for the purposes of completing the process. Wash your face and clean all the tiny bits of hair from it as well as the ones stuck inside your goatee.\nCircle beard\nIt does require quite a bit of maintenance but it looks great and it does provide you with a wide array of styles that you can choose from. You should check it out as it looks great and it suits just about any suit with the utmost perfection.\nHow to:\u00a0\nShape all corners to get a smooth round circle\u00a0that attaches the goatee. To do this kind of process you need to have a precise trimmer. You can also trim the beard\u00a0to a length you desire by holding the trimming machine at a consistent angle. Finally, take a look at you shave using a mirror.\nAll these styles showcase one of the best men's facial beards for fall. You can give them a shot if you want as the results are very good. Keep in mind that you can always experiment with new styles if you want, but these are usually tried and tested so they will provide a good value!\nOctober 25, 2016\nBeanies, Snapbacks & T-Shirts\nAbsolution Apparel Co.\nThere are many types of clothing items out there but while some are very popular, others don\u2019t really bring in front that much of a challenge to begin with.

So Save yourselves the embarrassment and humiliation, loose the Chin Strap and you will lose the douche (appearance)!!\nPosted by Peanut & Pickle at 4:20 PM\nI'm considering how I'm going to style my beard. I wanted to try the chin strap, the mutton chops, or the chin curtain beard. I used to just do the full beard until I seen how bad my facial hair looks (like pubic hair on my face), and how sparse it is in places (patchy on my cheeks), and so a full beard for me looks embarrassing. Right now, I'm leaning towards a chin-strap-goatee thing. I once tried a crescent-shaped goatee that sat right under my chin. But I haven't stopped to reconsider these ideas, and wondered if, instead of adding personality, or character, to my look, I might come off looking like a tool, or a douche, like the Jersey Shore reject pictured above (the only actual legitimate douche featured on this blog [except maybe for the blogger]). I've seen some guys with this type of beard that struck me as tools, and so I worried about the association I might have with them if I adopted this kind of beard style. Although I'd try to put my own stamp on it, and make it look unique. Overall, I don't think it looks so bad, and it depends on the guy.\nReally .... here's the only sensible verdict coming from the only sensible person on this page: it doesn't fucking matter. I believe in the freedom of the individual. You can dress or adorn yourself in ANY WAY YOU WANT. I don't care if I don't like it. I don't care if I wouldn't do the same thing. It all depends on what YOU want to do, and fuck all with the rest. You might not have a style I like. So the hell what? Usually, I'll be cool about it, and not rip on you for it. I'm pretty accepting, and open-minded - pretty much down with however you want to be, even if I don't like you. It's a matter of the individual's choice, no matter how freakish; and I'm not about to ostracize you for it like a vicious, feeble-minded, elementary school kid, who feels repulsion at people's differences, and is insecure and confused about their place in the world, and has to open their foolish little mouths at any person who sticks out. You don't like the chin strap? Then don't wear it.\nSome of this blog was actually funny, and written decently. Mostly it oozed the insecurity, sexual frustration, and male-cattiness of yet another of these sad, pathetic, angry Internet men with no sense of fashion (admitted), style, what women want, what to do with women, or what to do with their lives. That was just too thickly palpable here, and I'd really rather not sit in the light of judgment from a much lesser man.\nahahaha this is the funniest shit ive seen in a while...nobody gives a fuck about your opinion...do you not have anything better to do? You probably dont even have pubes yet facial hair...why dont you stop rubbing yourself at the computer and try to find some ladies bro ;)\nAnd no, lipstick on your hand does not count as a blowjob either..\nAHAHAHAHA ^^^\nIve had a chinstrap for the past 4 years, and im no man whore, but in those 3 years ive dated some of the best looking women around; as far as im concerned, its classy and women like it, along with facial hair in general. #chinstrap4life\nChinstraps & Jersey Shore = Douchebags\nJust 2 friends Peanut and Pickle who decided they had things to say.\nWords of Wisdom\n\u201cEvery day, think as you wake up, today I am fortunate to be alive, I have a precious human life, I am not going to waste it. I am going to use all my energies to develop myself, to expand my heart out to others; to achieve enlightenment for the benefit of all beings. I am going to have kind thoughts towards others, I am not going to get angry or think badly about others. I am going to benefit others as much as I can.\u201d ~Dalai Lama\nAwesome Inc. theme.

There are plenty of goatee styles available right now and it\u2019s clear to see why. There\u2019s a type of goatee for every age, skin color and face shape. Business men, workers, college students and hipsters all love the goatee look. Even celebrities can\u2019t get enough of this manly look, sporting a goatee regardless of the year and fashion trends.\nBut goatee styles require maintenance so get ready to put your shaving skills to the test. \u00a0You will need a beard trimmer and you have to decide which goatee shape to go for but other than that you are good to go.\n1.\u00a0Robert Pattinson Goatee Style\nIt looks like Robert Pattinson gave in to the goatee style look. Celebrity goatee styles prove once more that having a goatee can really make a difference.\n2. 80s Chin Goatee Style\nThis grey goatee style is a killer. Older men can look amazing just by going for the chin goatee style that works well for any age group and hair color. This was one of the most popular chin goatee styles back in the 80s and it seems it still has its legion of fans.\n3. Stylish African American Looks\nThe right accessories (the shades, the jewelry and whatnot) can highlight a flawless look from head to toe. Not to mention a small goatee that goes well with an urban look.\n4. The Barely Noticeable Goatee\nThis popular look has been redefined by fashion whims and trends, looking better and better each passing day thanks to the new shapes invented by celebrities, barbers and stylists. The barely noticeable goatee is the perfect choice for those men who prefer to play the subtle card.\n5. Ice Cube\u2019s Famous Goatee\nThere are many images that capture Ice Cube\u2019s iconic goatee. The abundance of black male goatee styles makes it hard to pick a favorite. The 90s popular goatee styles keep making a comeback thanks to celebrities like Ice Cube.\n6. Will Smith\u2019s Grey Goatee Style\nWill Smith is one trendy actor that is also famous for his inspired looks. His grey goatee has been trimmed to perfection.\n7. Cool Mustache Goatee\nThe classic look for goatees usually implies having a moustache and a beard. Men have been preoccupied with their facial hair for centuries now and the goatee is the result of decades of experimenting. So feel free to try out different looks with or without a mustache, depending on your face type.\n8. The Laid Back Look\nMore and more hipsters are into goatee coloring to look older. You can actually dye your goatee any color that you can think of, but if you want to achieve the laid back look better go for grey goatees.\n9. Styling a Goatee\nBeards, goatees and mustaches all need to be styled. It may take a little extra time from your part, but in the end it\u2019s worth it.\n10. Leonardo DiCaprio Goatee Style Beard\nEverybody knows that Leonardo DiCaprio is a man\u2019s man so it\u2019s only natural that he would grow a beard to match that stunning goatee.\n11. Nice Looking Facial Hair Goatee Styles\nThis subtle cool goatee style deserves your attention. It\u2019s the kind of goatee that goes well with any fashion style that you can think of.\n12. Goatee for Bald Men\nThis seems like the perfect choice for bald men who like the bad boy look. The shades seem to draw attention to a flawless goatee.\n13. Goatee for Black Men\nAmazing can\u2019t even begin to describe this flawless looking goatee. Its avant-garde cut can leave anyone breathless. African American goatee styles are very popular since they flatter black men so easily.\n14. Black Men Goatee Styling\nBlack mens goatee styles lean more towards an audacious look; a daring goatee trim that can be spotted from miles away.\n15. Thin Goatee\nThe thin goatee style is recommended for older men who want to look younger. It\u2019s a very low maintenance goatee style that is worth a chance.\n16. Full Goatee Style\nThe lumberjack look has received a modern retouch. It is also recognized thanks to the full goatee style that highlights one\u2019s masculinity.\n17. Relaxed Goatee\nWhat men seem to appreciate the most when it comes to best goatee styles is the fact that any goatee look can be altered as to flatter one\u2019s facial features. This unique trait can make any man feel good about himself.\n18. The Gray Goatee\nStyling beards isn\u2019t that hard; especially when the beard is highlighted by a perfect goatee. Older men can look incredibly handsome when sporting such a fine goatee.\n19. Ryan Reynolds\u2019 Hunk Look\nYou can shave your goatee or let it look a bit messy. Take Ryan Reynolds\u2019 goatee for example. The slightly negligent look suits him like a glove.\n20. Mel Gibson\u2019s Daring Goatee\nMel Gibson shows that long goatee styles can be one inspired choice. Goatee and mustache styles have been around for quite some time and many actors have decided to revive this look because it is associated with manliness.\n21. Mustache and Goatee Style\nStyling a goatee can be tricky at times; this is why you should go to a barber\u2019s salon first and go for what the stylist recommends you in terms of length, shape and hair care. You should know that the best goatee beard styles for men are the ones that come with a fabulous mustache.\n22. Bradley Cooper\u2019s Take on Goatees\nShort goatee styles can easily pass as the five o\u2019clock shadow. Bradley Cooper is a big fan of the all-American, masculine look and he definitely owns that goatee.\n23. The Pirate Look\nOrlando Bloom looks like a bad guy which proves that short goatees can be very versatile and the difference is marked by style, attitude and face shape.\n24. So Classy, So Beautiful\nMens goatee styles are appropriate in various contexts from business appointments to formal meetings or casual dates and whatnot.

Beards Are In\nBeards have been trending for years now. Add a stylish goatee and you can nail one inspired look.\n27.

The Typical Look\nGoatees have started as facial hair growing on a man\u2019s chin. In time, due to its increasing popularity, the goatee has suffered numerous changes.\n33. Undercuts and Goatees\nThe hairstyle is as important as the goatee itself so if you plan on drawing people\u2019s attention, go for an undercut to match a thick goatee.\n34. David Beckham, the Trendsetter\nEverybody perceives David Beckham as a fashion icon and he certainly deserves this title. His type of goatee is recommended for guys with round faces.\n35. Modern Goatee Style\nMost goatee styles for men are a modern interpretation of the old ones. There are so many different styles of beards and goatees, thus helping any man find the right style for him. This is the main purpose of a modern goatee style.\n36. Thick Goatee\u00a0\nThere are plenty of goatee styles for older men. Most of them are low-maintenance and require regular trimming but that\u2019s about it.\n37. Goatee without Mustache\u00a0\nSome men prefer a goatee without a mustache and the look goes well with casual fashion styles best.\n38. The Long, Manly Goatee\nThis kind of goatee beard style requires more maintenance but it is worth the trouble nevertheless.\n39. Bryan Cranston Is Too Cool for You\nBryan Cranston proves how inspired a goatee can be for a bald, older man.\n40. Man Buns and Goatees\nAnother inspired choice is highlighting a goatee by going for a man bun. It\u2019s a trending look and it may not last for too long, but it is certainly worth a shot.\nLeave a Reply\nComment\nName *\nEmail *\nWebsite\nPopular Posts\n60 Military Haircut Ideas In the past couple of years, the military haircut has\u2026\n60 Cristiano Ronaldo Haircut Ideas Whether known by his full name or simply by the\u2026\n"

Do you love beards, dream of them, obsess over them and find your beard-loving tendencies sometimes get in the way of living a normal life? Then that would be a yes. We see a lot of pogonophiles selling wares from their ex's on our site -- a lot of these ladies are the first to admit that their furry obsessions are a bit over the top. But according to research , they're not alone. Close to 70 percent of women are. When did bearded men start getting all the babes? We've done our own research on the history of beards in America to shed some light on this hairy situation.\nPrehistoric Blankets Beards\nScientists believe prehistoric men had beards for warmth, intimidation and protection purposes. If you're sleeping outside, it helps to have a face full of fur.\n16th Century Macho Beards\nVery great beards came from this century, namely the forked beard and stiletto beard. A beard was seen as a symbol of masculinity, courage and power. The bigger the beard, the bigger the... you get the drift.\n18th Century Baldies\nDue in part to the influence of the Puritans, the beard was out. Instead, masculinity was portrayed through tights and powdered wigs. No comment.\n19th Century  Presidential Beards\nPresident Abraham Lincoln was the first president to don a beard. He made beards a thing across the US throughout much of this century.  Perhaps he thought it looked tough? Perhaps he didnt have time to shave? Either way, he brought back the beard.\n1900-1950s Hello Mo'\nBeards began a slow decline in popularity by the turn of the century. Most men who retained facial hair throughout the first half of the 20th century limited themselves to a mustache or goatee. Yes, this includes the chinstrap, pencil and handlebar.\n1960-1970s Hippy Hair\nThe beard was first reintroduced to society by beatniks and hippies (kind of like the hipsters of today). But it wasn't until after the Vietnam War that beards' popularity really took off.  The hippies were too busy smoking reefers to shave, but now even the businessmen had given up on razors and took to drinking scotch in boardrooms instead.\n1980s Luscious Locks\nThe popularity of beards subsided in this decade. When men look as great as Patrick Swayze and John Stamos who really needed a beard anyway, right?\n1990s Getting Fancy\nThe beard continued to take a backseat to other facial hair trends, e.g. goatees, super marios and long side burns. Let's keep those in the '90's, yeah?\n2000s-Present Beard Overload\nThe beard has been growing in popularity since the mid 2000s. But it wasn't until spring of 2013,  that the full beard took over the fashion world. The beard is hot. I mean, men are even getting beard transplants. Seriously. For the minority of you that aren't about that beard hype, don't fret. I history really does repeat itself, we expect the beard trend to soon take a backseat to other furry fads soon enough.\nFollow Annabel Acton on Twitter: www.twitter.com/neverlikedit\nAnnabel Acton Founder, Never Liked It Anyway\nMORE:\nSUBSCRIBE TO & FOLLOW LIFESTYLE\nWe\u2019re basically your best friend\u2026 with better taste.

I, on the other hand, am more a man (read lad aged 16) of the moustache. I gladly shave off my sprouting beard in favor of a tastefull moustache. Can someone explain me the Beard love?\nSincerely, a moustache rights activist.\nI lack in both because I look appalling with facial hair\nA beard is manly.  It shows that you're not afraid to look like a man.\nAn unkempt beard is lazy.  Shave your neck at least.  That shows that your beard is a choice, and not a de-facto state because you couldn't be bothered.\nA mustache alone makes you look either like a porn star or a dictator.  Neither will make a positive impression.\nRedbeard wrote:\nA mustache alone makes you look either like a porn star or a dictator.\nI like where this is heading.\nI just want to have a moustache for a short period in my life, it's too cool to shave off. IMHO.\nI'm totally cool with this.\nIf it's a pedo stache, it's not cool. Other than that, I'm down with any stache beard combo.\nThe moustache, well executed, can transcend even the beard in awesomeness.  However, to achieve such glorious results it must be grown to a thickness greater than an inch - the so called Mercury Minimum.  Ideally, it should also develop its own flair, either the classic Mexican Bandito twirl, a french twist or flick, or the daring catfish barbels.  All of these require a 'stache of exceptional thickness and body (much like a porn star) and utilize the bareness of the chin to flaunt their facial hair.\nThink of it as a two-piece beard, and ask yourself if you're the sort of guy that would wear a bikini if he were a lady.  do you really have the facial assets to pull it off and turn heads without people wandering where the rest of it is?\nIf yes, lucky you!  Go enjoy your soup strainer.  If no, I highly recommend the stylish goatee.  It is a classy statement of manliness that looks equally at home in the office, or relaxing by the pool.\n'stache has to be well done to work. Beard is easier to pull off these days.\nBeards tend to be a little harder to screw up than mustaches - how many names can you think of off the top of your head for bad beards, as opposed to ones for a bad 'stache?\nI am a moustache sporting man myself...... if i shave the bloody thing off though i look like i am 12.

You don't need to be wearing any facial hair until you are able to grow non patchy hair, or if you are dating a hippy chick with hair in her pits.\nMustaches - In current American society, having one is hard to pull off. Whether you believe it or not, having many styles actually can label you as Gay, especially if you are either a short male, or a super star model with a hairless body and 6 packs. There is a strong aversion to mustaches because usually pedophiles have them as seen on t.v., and this is what sticks into most people's back-brain. There is actually something unsettling about having a mustache. Oddly enough, if you have a 'crazy' mustache, such as a handle bar or German swoosh style 'staches, they can be seen as very unique, distinct and manly.\nBeards - SHAVE. YOUR. NECK. It does many things. Shaving your neck makes you appear thinner with a sharper jaw line. It shows you have class. Having a full beard can be seen as a sign of a lumberjack/hillbilly/mountain man. If you sport a beard for X weeks/months, then shave it, you will appear years younger to people for about half the time you had the beard. Also, don't attempt to grow a beard unless you can grow a beard that is full and not patchy. Patchy hair makes you look dirty and disgusting. If you can only grow patchy hair, God didn't intent for you to have one. Unless you are a dumpster diving hippy.\nMustaches two thumbs down unless you are going nutz.\nBeards two thumbs up only if you know how to wear one.\nFacial Hair is almost always a bad decision. Don't ruin a perfectly good face by stapling a rat to it. A mustache is all that much worse because you not only look like you stapled a rat to your face but it's a creepy rat. A creepy rat that probably molests children, or ties people to train tracks, or has a mullet or some combination of those three.\nChongara wrote:\nFacial Hair is almost always a bad decision.

I was thinking on buying one of these trimmer kit things. Are they worth it, or will a good old pair of nail scissors and patience bring about the same results?\nAny advice will be appreciated.\nOh and I'm nearly two weeks in, so my mustache has got to, spikey, its sticking out in odd directions, could do with a brush and trim time.\nThe electric razor is indispensable when it comes to high quality facial hair.  Well, not indispensable, but far more convenient than the alternative; basically shaving every day, using the scissors you mentioned, and obtaining a straight razor for those times you might let it go a bit.\nFrom left to right, Mr. T, Jerry Garcia, Abe Lincoln, Shakespeare, Darwin, van Gogh, Freud, Lemmy Kilmister from Motorhead and Frederick Douglass\nI'm pretty sure Lemmy Kilmister's facial hair resembles a mustache more than beard and according to Wikipedia he has slept with over 1200 women, (I however remain doubtful) so therefore I think it's safe to conclude that the mustache wins more\nladies than the beard.\nRuglud wrote:\nFrom left to right, Mr. T, Jerry Garcia, Abe Lincoln, Shakespeare, Darwin, van Gogh, Freud, Lemmy Kilmister from Motorhead and Frederick Douglass\nNo Marx?\ndogma wrote:\nRuglud wrote:\nFrom left to right, Mr. T, Jerry Garcia, Abe Lincoln, Shakespeare, Darwin, van Gogh, Freud, Lemmy Kilmister from Motorhead and Frederick Douglass\nNo Marx?\nI long to grow \"The Marx\" but I'm currently in process of the \"Lenin\"\nWhy do lefties all ways have the best beards?\nAlso, cant believe no-ones mentioned the Wargamers Traditional \"NeckBeard\"\nWhat's the origin of the neckbeard?

That thing is just plan horrible.\nIn fact I had pretty much this exact conversation with my roommate after watching a movie where a mustache like that had a lot of screen time:\nMe:  \"Ugh, he really needs to shave. That thing is an eyesore\"\nHer: \"Really? It's awesome\"\nMe:  \"You've to be kidding, it's gross\"\nHer: \"Well yeah, I could never date or touch a man with a mustache like that, but it's still awesome in a way\"\nMe:  \"I guess I get what you're saying, but still\"\nSo yeah. A mustache might make you a neat side-show, something kind of cool to gawk at, like a car crash, explosion, crazed badger or a mullet. However like all those things it's not really something most people want to get close to.\nOkay, so Lemmy is questionable (I didn't create the image!), but there's a simple test of which is best...\nYou decide...\nArmy allows us to grow a mustache, however my unit will not allow it.\nYou see there's a rule about mustaches in the Army (if you're an infantryman)\nIf you see a man with a mustache in the Army, he probably:\n1.Has a better job than you\n2.Gets paid more\nCT GAMER wrote:\nSometimes the stupidity/humor of certain facial hair style is half the fun.

They want their soul patch back\nGetty Images\nEvery decade has its style, whether it\u2019s top hats and monocles or parachute pants and Airwalks. Facial hair is no different. Every mutton chop, soul patch, and handlebar mustache belongs to its own special time\u2014and just because these guys belong in the modern decade doesn\u2019t mean their beards do. Here are 13 modern men with decade-specific facial fuzz. Where does yours belong?\n1860: The Chin Curtain\nBefore the Civil War, gents favored a clean shave. In fact, Abe Lincoln was the first bearded president. With him came the \u201cchin curtain,\u201d a beard that starts just above your jaw line and goes straight down. Abe made his extra chin-y by wearing it without a mustache , and to be perfectly honest, no one has pulled it off since.\nThe face-flanking beasts known as sideburns didn\u2019t get their name until the spectacularly scruffy Civil War general Ambrose Burnside rose to fame. His cottony white cheek fluff grew to magnificent length and connected over his lip, leaving his chin bare. It\u2019s a look that makes a man look like a zany inventor\u2014or a meme.\n1880/90: The Full Bush\nThanks to history's two hairiest presidents\u2014Rutherford Hayes and, briefly, James Garfield\u2014the last part of the century was a beard-growin' free-for-all. In this bushy period, long before the invention of the electric clipper, facial hair was allowed to be free. There is a strong possibility that your facial hair right now is nostalgic for this era.\n1900/10: The Handlebar Mustache\n\u00a0\n1920: The Distinguished Uncle\nWhile the young gents of the roaring \u201820s were ducking in and out of speakeasies, full beards made a comeback on a distinguished set of older gents. Think snowy-haired industrialists and railroad tycoons . Or Harrison Ford in one of his don\u2019t-be-fooled-by-the-gray-I-can-still-knock-you-out phases.\nFirst there was the Charlie Chaplin mustache\u2014also known as the \u201ctoothbrush mustache\u201d because it was about the size and shape of a toothbrush. Let\u2019s not talk about that one. It went out of fashion hard. Then came the \u201cpencil mustache,\u201d popularized by Clark Gable. This thin strip across the upper lip stays out of the way of the nose, and looks down upon heavier mustaches.\n1940/50: Birth of the Goatee\nDizzy Gillespie brought in the soul patch, and the Beatnik movement birthed the goatee. The early look was neat and thin\u2014think of it as a natural outgrowth of the pencil mustache. An outgrowth that could be thoughtfully stroked in a smoky jazz club.\n1960: The Goatee Grows Up\nCounter culture. Coffee houses. Che Guevara. It was time to let those goatees be free. Mustaches reconnected with noses. Soul patches attained the length that would eventually qualify them as \u201cflavor savors.\u201d Men let their facial hair be, well, hairy, with the concept of \u201cscruff\u201d joining the revolution.\n1970: The Horseshoe Mustache\nThe \u201870s were a huge decade for hair in general. Guys quit going to the barber. The Bee Gees were a thing. The explosion of facial hair provided the perfect canvas for the decade\u2019s greatest invention: the horseshoe mustache. It will forever belong to Hulk Hogan, but it\u2019s available to any guy who wants to throw on a trucker hat and crush a beer in his fist.\nThe \u201880s were a mustache cage match, and there was one winner: Tom Selleck. This paragon of manhood introduced the world to his full, luxurious, lip ornament on \u201cMagnum PI.\u201d We shudder to think of him without it. Stay strong, Tom. For you, every month is Movember.\nRemember those well-behaved midcentury goatees? The \u201890s made the goatee-soul-patch combo the new facial hair of alt rock. It became bold and thick. We\u2019re looking at you, Fred Durst, Kid Rock, Rob Zombie\u2014the list goes on. With the right attitude, any guy can still embrace this \u201890s vibe.\u00a0\n2000: Five o\u2019 Clock Shadow Plus\nThe early aughts were all about almost growing a beard. Think Keanu Reeves and Colin Farrell with soft patches of scruff dappling their jaw lines. It was a soft look that said, \u201cNever mind my beard, girl, get lost in my eyes.\u201d It was self-assured but not hyper-masculine. Which meant another big beard \u00a0blast was imminent.\n2010: Lumbersexuals\nGrow \u2018em long. Grow \u2018em strong. The \u201ctwenty-teens\u201d have been defined by the biggest beard volumes in over a century. Wild and scraggly, billowing, and unkempt, these are the beards of guys who just rode in from the frontier, and are now enjoying a chai latte at their boutique design firm. But, hey, when you can impress people with the sheer number of days it\u2019s been since you last shaved, why not keep it up another week? Or another decade.\n{* loginWidget *}\n{* /signInForm *}             By logging in, you confirm that you accept our terms of service and have read and understand privacy policy .\nSign In\nAlmost Done!\nPlease confirm the information below before signing in.\n{* #socialRegistrationForm *}         {* emailAddress *}         {* displayName *}         By clicking \"Sign in\", you confirm that you accept our terms of service and have read and understand privacy policy .\n{* backButton *}\n{* /socialRegistrationForm *}\nAlmost Done!\nPlease confirm the information below before signing in.

With the right attitude, any guy can still embrace this \u201890s vibe.\u00a0\n2000: Five o\u2019 Clock Shadow Plus\nThe early aughts were all about almost growing a beard. Think Keanu Reeves and Colin Farrell with soft patches of scruff dappling their jaw lines. It was a soft look that said, \u201cNever mind my beard, girl, get lost in my eyes.\u201d It was self-assured but not hyper-masculine. Which meant another big beard \u00a0blast was imminent.\n2010: Lumbersexuals\nGrow \u2018em long. Grow \u2018em strong. The \u201ctwenty-teens\u201d have been defined by the biggest beard volumes in over a century. Wild and scraggly, billowing, and unkempt, these are the beards of guys who just rode in from the frontier, and are now enjoying a chai latte at their boutique design firm. But, hey, when you can impress people with the sheer number of days it\u2019s been since you last shaved, why not keep it up another week? Or another decade.\n{* loginWidget *}\n{* /signInForm *}             By logging in, you confirm that you accept our terms of service and have read and understand privacy policy .\nSign In\nAlmost Done!\nPlease confirm the information below before signing in.\n{* #socialRegistrationForm *}         {* emailAddress *}         {* displayName *}         By clicking \"Sign in\", you confirm that you accept our terms of service and have read and understand privacy policy .\n{* backButton *}\n{* /socialRegistrationForm *}\nAlmost Done!\nPlease confirm the information below before signing in.

                            "text": "On Thursday night, at an undisclosed bearded location, we met up with the incredible Jack Passion to discuss the joys, thrills, and slight annoyances with sporting the best beard in the world ! \u00a0 \u00a0\nAs a woman, it took me a while to take in the large-scale beauty of Mr. Passion's beard. \u00a0Certainly, as co-founder of this blog, I love facial hair of all shapes and sizes, but this got me to thinking.... what if... what *IF* your significant other wasn't down with your facial hair?\nJack:\u00a0Your partner needs to understand where you're coming from and what this process can mean to a man. S/he is seeing the beginning stages and maybe cringing, but you're seeing the potential.\u00a0 It takes a little time before the beard starts looking how you want it. \u00a0But if you're close with your partner and if you support one another, s/he will be there for the bad - before it gets good.\u00a0 You could also just ask him or her if they love you... and follow it directly by saying - #PROVEIT!\nI am sure eating gets in the way with a beard that size. \u00a0Am I wrong? \u00a0\nJack:\u00a0It's only the mustache that makes eating difficult. \u00a0I keep mine trimmed, and I know guys who just manage.\u00a0 If you can't handle the heat, get out the kitchen.\u00a0 Sacrifices must be made in the path to legendary greatness .\nHow do you manage that mane? \u00a0Do you comb it? \u00a0Do you hire someone to handle it?\u00a0\nJack:\u00a0I use a comb, but only because my beard is long.\u00a0 You don't have to buy into the hype and get a really expensive comb, but just don't use a plastic one.\u00a0 Avoid seams because seams snag.\u00a0 Bakelite is cheap, easy, and readily available.\u00a0 However, most guys only need a quality boar bristle brush to distribute oils and stimulate the face underneath.\nAnd what about the men who have patchy beards? \u00a0Any advice? \u00a0\nJack:\u00a0A lot of men's faces don't fill out 'til much later in their life.\u00a0 Despite evidence that men peak sexually in their early 20s, they might not get a full beard until their 40s.\u00a0 Rock what you've got.\u00a0 So what if you've a patchy beard?\u00a0 Nobody's going to know that because your mustache (or sideburns, or goatee, or whatever) looks so fresh. \u00a0\u00a0\n*Build-a-Beard founders hanging with Passion.\nNo doubt you\u2019ve heard the name\u2026 it rolls of your tongue like the feel of a cool breeze going through your beard on a hot summer day. Jack Passion ( http://jackpassion.com and @ jackpassion )\u2026 say it with us\u2026 Jack, Passion\u2026 yes, the very same that has amassed two wins in the Natural Beard category at World Beard and Mustache Championships at the age of 25\u2026 yep, that author who tackled beards chin on with The Facial Hair Handbook the must have beard growers book\u2026 the very same Jack Passion that signs his emails \u201cLove and Passion\u201d\u2026 people like that just warm our heart\u2026and yes, the very same with a giant orange beard.\n\u201cJack Passion is to the sport of bearding what Tiger Woods is to the sport of golf.\u201d\nWe try to be inspiring here at B-a-B, but truth be told we like nothing else than being inspired by the bearded community as well\u2026 Clearly, Jack is in a league all his own in terms of inspiration; Jack even was one of his graduating class\u2019 speakers at UCSC among other things\u2026 we should probably continue writing up this interview while bowing our heads, and you should probably read it as such as well.\nEither way, when we heard that Jack wasn\u2019t competing in the 2011 World Championships we raced to meet this bass playing beard oracle to get some answers and gauge what this means for competitive bearding, do German\u2019s cry, what the end of Street Fighter II looks like and much, much more\u2026 so, enjoy!\nIt\u2019s an honor to be here by the side of such a beardo\u2026 your follicle awesomeness is an example to us all\u2026 how and when did you decide to grow it out and grow it proud?\nThe honor is mine!\u00a0 I never gave bearding much thought until I placed highly on the world stage.\u00a0 Prior to that, my beard was just another in a long line of facial hairstyles that I had worn.\u00a0 At some point, I had no choice but to accept my role as America's beard ambassador; the alternative would have been to shave - no thanks!\u00a0 Since that time, a great deal of thought and discussion has brought me and my beard to where we are today.\u00a0 My beard is my career, and I work hard.\nWhen did the decision to participate in competitive bearding come to be? And why, how\u2019d you even hear about Beard Team USA ?\nInitially, I just wanted a story to tell my grandchildren one day.\u00a0 I did not know the caliber of my beard, nor did I even know a fire burned in my heart to crush other men's dreams of bearded glory. Sometimes the spirit of competition must be awakened in the soul, like the premise of any good 80s action sports movie.\u00a0 I heeded the call to brush and condition my way to the top, a position from which I can hopefully lead by example that a bearded life is an authentic, honest, and honorable one.\nTell us about your first competition on the global level \u2026 did other beardos give you a hard time because some of their beards were older than you?\nThe first world competition I attended was in Berlin, and I \"only\" got third.\u00a0 There was quite a bit of outrage, but since it was in German, I had no idea.\u00a0 Later on, I was told that the older, German elite thought I was totally un-serious and that my pirate costume was disrespectful.\u00a0 They don't have to like me, as long as they fear me.\nMy world standings are as follows:\n2005, Berlin, 3rd place, Natural Full Beard\n2007, Brighton, 1st place, Natural Full Beard\n2009, Anchorage, 1st place, Natural Full Beard\nWe know that people love the beard\u2026 did having a few titles help to milk even more love from envious women (and scores of men)?\nYes.\u00a0 ;-)\nNice, we dig\u2026 Anyway, then comes Alaska\u2026 you win that championship too\u2026 how\u2019d you do it? What is it about your routine that you think sets you apart?\nI spell out my entire regimen and all of my trade secrets in my book, The Facial Hair Handbook .\u00a0 My program is pretty simple in concept, but I actually follow all of it to a tee, and I am unrelenting in my pursuit of perfection -- no detail is to be overlooked.\nWe will most certainly get to your hairy manuscript a bit later\u2026Why is the natural beard the most coveted title? Did the Germans cry like little babies after your 2nd win in a row?\nI don't know if there is one title more coveted than another, but Full Beard Natty is certainly the most competitive because of its size; more than half the competitors at the Anchorage contest were in my category.\nI don't know if they were crying, nor do I care.\u00a0 Nobody can hear their pitiful sobs over the roaring cheers of Passionate victory, anyway. Really though, everyone's a beardsman and after they warmed up to me, the Germans have always been really happy for me when I win.\u00a0 And if you've ever beaten Street Fighter II as Ryu , it's like that: I'm already on to the next match; I live for the thrill of the fight.\nAlso, despite the sometimes (ok, often) inflammatory rhetoric, I grow and wear a beard for many reasons higher in priority than competition.\u00a0 I have made some men jealous, but if there is envy or rage, it is only because I have yet to connect with these guys on a personal level.\u00a0 If I have a beard and you have a beard, we have something in common of great social and moral significance; a bond that makes us real friends before we even meet.\nSo now you are a two time champ, and yet you chose to not compete in the upcoming National Championships\u2026 what\u2019s the deal? Is winning THAT boring?\nI've logged the forest bare, and I need to let a few bearded trees grow again so that I can obliterate and tarnish their family names for all time once again.\nI've been a very prominent figure on the team, and since we're hosting it, I thought it'd just be a good move to sit it out.\u00a0 When I brought this up, the event planners offered the MC gig, and that's right up my alley, so I took it.\u00a0 I'm excited to relax and just have a good time with a bunch of good guys over a beautiful weekend in the Pacific Northwest, which to be fair, out-beards Brooklyn 10:1.\nI really encourage everyone in beards to come to Bend.\u00a0 It's super cheap to fly there, and this is not only your chance to do really well in a beard contest, but it's also shaping up to be the biggest facial hair event in history.\u00a0 Guinness will be on hand to record the number of contestants and spectators.\u00a0 Beard competitions are finally rising to the level of sports like World's Strongest Man and hot dog eating competitions.\u00a0 Anyone can do roids and get overpaid to play with balls.\u00a0 I say let's eat hot dogs, throw kegs over walls, and grow beards!\nWe'll start booking our trip tomorrow! In the meantime, tell us about your book\u2026 is a sequel planned? Perhaps a guide to manscaping, or a tome about sideburns? Stache excellence? Do tell\u2026 and also, who is your favorite author?\nThere is a lot of information on facial hair care in the world, but let's be honest:\u00a0 There's still a lot of shitty beards, and a lot of guys trying to grow beards end up quitting (and I say quitting instead of shaving, because it really is quitting; as in giving up, folding, submitting, and forfeiting) because it itches or someone tells them it sucks.\u00a0 I provide the motivation to go beards out, and the skill set to grow and wear facial hair to the best of your biological ability; in a practical and easy to follow format.\u00a0 Facial hair is an honest and natural thing, and I take a very holistic approach to equipping you with everything you need and nothing you don't.\u00a0 I know it sounds like a shameless plug, but it really will change a man's life. Plus, it makes a great gift. :)\nThe book has done really well, and I'm just about to release a revised second printing.\u00a0 The content is almost identical, but some design things have changed, most notably the cover.\nI don't really have a favorite author, but I tend to read a lot of philosophy and other non-fiction if that helps. But when you ask about a favorite author, I have to ask, were you guys trying to get me to plug garyvee ?\u00a0\nHaha, thanks for that\u2026 but not since he shaved ... You\u2019re an author and we figure you must be inspired by someone\u2026 bearded philosophers surely fit that bill. Finally\u2026 have you heard of Mane n\u2019Tail , if so\u2026 would you recommend it or even use it?\nIt smells good, it's inexpensive in bulk, and it gets the job done well, but it's a age-old myth of the beard community that it's some miracle beard wash/condish.\u00a0 Beard hair isn't head hair, but it sure isn't horse hair, either!\u00a0 That said, if they offered me an endorsement, I'd take it.\u00a0 You can do better ($$$$), but you can do muuuch worse.\ntagged\nDoors are at 7:00 p.m. - tickets are $12.00 - purchase them HERE .\u00a0\ntagged\nOur favorite late night talk show host will be on 60 Minutes this Sunday talking about his transition to TBS among other things... and now there is a leaked story that positions CoCo's statement that he \"wouldn't have done that\" (referring to Leno giving away, then taking back, The Tonight Show).\nWe here at B-a-B feel that regardless of what Conan said (or will say) on this matter, we stand behind him... he is correct in saying that there are things he wouldn't do that Leno does/did, and conversely there are things that Jay doesn't do that Conan happily does with a hairy smile... like, GROW A KICKASS BEARD.\nFor that, among many reasons (most notably that Conan's HS Alma Mater is the same as mine,\u00a0 Brookline High School FTW!)... we salute you Conan and stand with you chin to chin. GO COCO, GO !\nP.S. Even if Jay was to grow a beard (and with his chin it would sure to be HUGE), we will not support him... that time has passed, and the ship has sailed... we will however report on it if it does come to be. Below is an artist's (albeit a bad one) interpretation to hold you over.\nP.P.S. David Letterman... we do recall your awesome beard... when's it gonna come back? bring it back David, bring it back!\ntagged\nWell, I'm going where the water tastes like wine.\nWe can jump in the water, stay drunk all the time...\"\n-- Going Up the Country\nAs you likely know by now, we are huge fans of the bearded businesses, businessmen, products and technologies (would also have accepted: innovations, solutions, or initiatives)\u2026 That said, we support nearly any and all beardos and stache wearers with a story, we even stand chin to chin with some goatee wearers\u2026 but from time to time, a product comes along, that we would support with or without a bearded angle\u2026 one such amazing entity is FireFly Vodka .\nFirst a quick story\u2026\nAs far as we are concerned, it was me (El Beardo) that discovered a sweet nectar of the gods called FireFly Sweet Tea Vodka for the NYC market a few years ago... While on a road trip to Charleston SC, my wife and I stumbled across a drink called 'The Carolina Cocktail' (aka FireFly sweet tea vodka, lemonade, ice with a dash of club soda)\u2026 at the time the young company wasn\u2019t exporting its distilled goodness across state lines\u2026 never being the ones to take no for an answer, we went to the closest liquor store in town and bought a case\u2026 which we proceeded to distribute to our friends in the NYC area\u2026 fast forward a year, and wham\u2026 FireFly was on the top of everyone\u2019s tongue, and swishing in all of our mouths. A legend was cemented\n\u2026now to resume our programming already in progress\u2026\nIt should come as no surprise then why B-a-B asked the good folks at FireFly to sponsor of the 2010 Brooklyn Beard Ball \u2026 which they graciously did, by donating a full case of Sweat Tea Vodka to be flowing through our veins that one magic night in Greenpoint\u2026 to reinforce our perspective that everything can and should be connected back to facial hair, lo an behold, the founders of the distillery are BEARDOS (one ongoing, the other intermittent).\nSo, when given the chance... it's needless to say I raced down from NYC back to Wadmalaw Island in South Carolina to sit down with co-founder, and a full time beardo (since 2007), Scott Newitt, for a chat about where booze and facial hair cross, and who exactly are straws made for\u2026 expectantly so, the day started and ended the same way, with a few John Daly\u2019s.\n1) Tell us the history of Firefly... we've heard rumors of Kettle One defectors, secret recipes, unique distributors and much more... what's the real story of FireFly Sweet Tea Vodka (aka nectar of the gods)?\nMy partner, Jim Irvin, \"Sometimes Bearded\" and myself, Scott Newitt, \"Always Bearded\" met in 2003.  He is a winemaker and I was a Liquor/Wine Distributor.  He hired me to represent his wines.  We became friends and I showed him my still in 2003.\nWe started Firefly Distillery in 2005 and made our first vodka out of his muscadine wine.  We introduced the world's first Sweet Tea Vodka on April 15, 2008.  He and I own the company and will not sell out to the big guys.  We love what we do.\nLoving what they do... Co-founders Scott and Jim, with production manager Jay\n2) Does FireFly use American tea for the infusion? We know there is only one tea plantation in the US (surprisingly), if you do use them (or if you've just had their tea) how's the quality... can we take India and china on?\nWe started off using only American Tea but as we grew we had to source outside the US.  We still use tea from the Charleston Tea Plantation and are the only liquor company to get there tea.  It is fantastic tea and indeed the only tea plantation in North America.\n3) How did the other flavors come around? How can we get on the focus group list...?\nI looked at flavors that were working for companies like Snapple.  Their top 2 flavors are Peach and Raspberry and so are ours.  WE will start checking out next year\u2019s flavors in October.  Come on down.\n4) What is the best way to drink FireFly sweet tea vodka?\nI like it poured over crushed ice.  I then let it melt for 2 min.  Then drink!  That is my favorite.  The most popular drink is 1/2 Firefly and 1/2 Fresh Lemonade.  Lots of folks call it \"The John Daily\"\n5) How long have you had your beard? How was the decision made?\nI have had a beard off and on for the last 20 years.  In 2007, I decided to keep it.  My wife likes me with a beard now.  Honestly, I got tired of shaving every morning.\n6) Do you think this is 'The Year of the beard'? Have you been noticing more beardos around SC?\nI do think it is the Year of the beard.  We have many beards in SC.  Seems like the 21-29 age group has the most here.\n7) South Carolina recently had a beard and mustache championship regional event (held by the good folks of Holy City Beard & Moustache Society ), did you go?\nI did not make it... I was out of town working and promoting Firefly.\n8) Who are some of the beardos that inspired you to grow yours out? mentors? idols?\nI love music and old TV shows... so, Willie Nelson is an inspiration as well as Uncle Jesse from The Dukes of Hazzard.\n9) What's the best way to drink a cocktail with a beard? Straws are a safe options, any other advice?\nStraws are for women and unbearded folks.  Beards are designed to pick up drinks and food.  I suggest drinking straight from the glass.\n10) What else do we need to know about you and your awesome distillery?\nI love music and have played the drums since 2nd grade.  We just came out with Firefly Sweet Tea Bourbon.  It is most definitely a Beard drink.\nThanks for taking the time Scott, keep up the great work on the chin and in the bottle!\nThanks and come visit!  Check out www.fireflyvodka.com for latest news and more info.\nWith the then still honorable (yet never bearded) Gov. Sanford.\ntagged\n\u00a0Earlier this week our good friend @Dissentertainer pointed us in the direction of an awesome post about poets ranked by their beard weight ... and we thought, hey they wont out do us! So, here we are... and yes, while the post was great (see the compilation photo below and the link to the story) we will not stand idly by and wait for others to dictate their beardly decision to us!!\nSo, before you peruse their findings (which are excerpted and abridged from The Language of the Beard, originally circulated by The Torchbearer Society, London, 1913... with Commentary by Gilbert Alter-Gilbert) and can be found at the bottom of our post... take a look at our Top-3 Poetic Beardos, and of course... they are part of our community!\n1) Magnus Holmgren (aka @ poetisk ) -- We've known Magnus since almost the first day we went live on twitter... and have been trying to get him on B-a-B ever since. He tweets very interesting stuff, and frankly, his facial hair style is nearly unmatched... we love him so much we are willing to look past the New York Yankees hat (dude you're from Sweden, you MUST root for the Red Sox!)\n2) Johnny Park (of The Oh Eeks )-- A lady friend of Johnny's got in touch with us about using the below shot... we were smitten rather immediately, but Johnny can thank our Facebook follower Rachel Commerford for this inclusion (even though your beard is rather nice), as we're not even sure that you're a follower of B-a-B... Rachel, you get a gold star.\n=========================================================================\nI was somewhere around the office, on the east edge of Manhattan, when the fear began to take hold. I was headed to LaGuardia Airport just as I read a headline about flights to Canada being delayed or canceled because of the ash plume... I got worried for a second, I remember saying out loud \"NH is not that high up north...\"\nHeading to Manchester for a 30 hour business romp, I jumped in a cab, got through security and to the terminal in record time... now facing more than an hour at the gate before boarding... So, as always, I was scouting beards ... While there were surprisingly many there that day, for some reason, I  wasn't on my game... the blame has to be the rigid environment of airports and the overarching  loathing of travel that would preclude me from approaching other  high strung beardos... or we can just blame Eyjafjallajokull.\nThat said, I did see a gent with an interesting and very neat beard style (thick but short trimmed side burns, with a twice as bushy goatee)... Finally, I get on the plane; a worn looking sucker with two propellers, with the landing gear that somehow folds in side them... Scary... Res ipsa loquitur\u2026 Let the good times roll.\nUpon landing in MHT, and making a B-line to the men's room, like clockwork I came across that very beardo! Clearly, the beard gods were making me tell him about B-a-B and comment on his awesome facial hair DIY... it worked before ... so we get to talking, and lo and behold Mr. JD Wilson divulges the secret to his tidy bushiness... it's a product called MANE 'n TAIL ... yes, as in horse.\nJD went on and on (about bees wax) and on and on (about mineral oils)... all to assure me that yes, while it's true this product was originally intended for horses, it does work wonders AND has a cult following, for HUMANS... all while we're standing in the men's room of the arrivals terminal.\nAnd so dear B-a-B fans, I'm proud to present my bounty of beard scouting  from New Hampshire... Search and ye shall find... Per their own Facebook group info:\nMane 'n Tail products were originally developed for horses. People  started using the products to achieve the beautiful results they saw  with their own horses manes and tails. This is where the legend of Mane n  Tail products comes from, by nourishing, conditioning and fortifying the hair and scalp to aid healthier hair growth.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIt is time to meet tax policy professor John Yeutter and familiarize yourself with the St. Louis-based American Mustache Institute .\u00a0 Why?\u00a0\u00a0Last week,\u00a0they proposed that mustached Americans get in on the stimulus money.\u00a0 Prior to the deadline to file income tax returns, the professor and AMI\u00a0pushed for The STACHE Act, which\u00a0offers incentives for people of Mustached American heritage in the form of the a $250 deduction for expenditures for mustache grooming supplies in the determination of Adjusted Gross Income (we couldn't even make this up if we tried...).\u00a0\nAMI is an advocacy organization protecting the rights of, and fighting discrimination against, mustached Americans by promoting the growth, care, and culture of the mustache.\u00a0The organization stated that\u00a0the current system of our government \"provides a disincentive for the clean-shaven to enjoy the mustached American lifestyle.\"\u00a0 They\u00a0argue that\u00a0the stimulus money could be used not only for trimming instruments but for wax, combs and mirrors.\nIf you wish to read the white paper on the study, sign the petition, and download a form to write to your congressman - click HERE .\u00a0 More information on The STACHE Act:\nMustaches have been making\u00a0headlines lately -\u00a0Associated Press dedicated an entire story on the history of John Stossel's 'stache , Huffington Post dedicated an entire slide show to media mustaches , Charlie Sheen lost his mind and faked one for \"fun,\" and Zac Efron grew a 'stache at Coachella.\u00a0\nThanks to our good friend Scott Baldwin (aka @scbaldwin ) for alerting us to a beardo interview deep within the pages of GQ... we know, we know, we're pretty shocked too (but it's about damn time)... upon closer review,\u00a0 we here at B-a-B have found a new hero, in one Patrick Melcher.\nWhile we've written about awesome skater beardos before ( Scott Herskovitz : Proving it Doggy Style ) and we've supported beardo skater art for some time (i.e. Art Bombs creations on Tumblr)... Patrick's feat is not to be outdone -- and we're not just talking about being a proud beardo in the pages of GQ). In addition to throwin it down on the street (do skaters throw down?), Patrick got 2nd place at the World Beard and Mustache Championships , yeah that's right... 2nd place! And how could he not, check out his awesome facial DIY creation below, as well as an excerpt of the GQ interview.\nCheck him out, he's worth it...\n\"GQ: How did the 'stache come about?\nMelcher: My teammate Richie Jackson was the direct influence.  And I grew this really neat mustache, then put it on my webpage , and this dude contacted me. \"You should join our beard club.\" So I joined the Bristly Chaps of Los Angeles beard club, and they invited me to the world championships in Anchorage. So I went and won second place for the Imperial Mustache. It was in the L.A. Times, TMZ, and on CNN.\"\nThe National . \u00a0Not only is this band of New Yorkers transplanted from Ohio music to my ears, but they're not bad on beards either. \u00a0During Sad Songs for Dirty Lovers, Cherry Tree (EP),\u00a0Alligator, and Boxer, the band sported some spotty (if not - barely existent) scruff, but it seems that with the release of High Violet \u00a0on May 11th- all beardos are on board. \u00a0\nBefore, singer and songwriter Matt Berninger \u00a0(currently living in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn... yea, we stalked it out) could be recognized for his distinctive, deep, baritone voice - but now his bushy beard is keeping B-a-B's full attention. We are huge fans of The National and to this day, one of my all-time favorite interview answers came in 2008 when NY Magazine \u00a0wanted Matt to describe the strangest comparison he has heard so far about\u00a0describing\u00a0his voice:\u00a0\n\"It's like chocolate and wool.\" I'm like, \"What?\" Someone else said I sound like a combination of Ian Curtis and Rain Man, which I thought was good. Even when it's an insult it's sort of flattering. \u00a0\nUpcoming tour schedule can be found\u00a0 HERE . \u00a0I'll be scouting beards in July at Prospect Park for this concert so come find me with your best DIY facial hair. \u00a0\n*High Violet tracks\nLadies, did you know that a man's beard grows the fastest when he anticipates\u00a0sex? Could this be the reason why so many hipsters in Brooklyn and the LES are sporting (and sprouting) beards lately? \u00a0The recession economy has forced many laid off workers to sit around and look longingly at their spouses... and what else is there really to do while you wait for your unemployment check to arrive ? \u00a0\nThe reason for this beard-growing phenomenon is apparently rooted in hormonal activities. Facial hair, a secondary male sexual characteristic, is largely governed by production of male hormones called androgens . Indeed, one of these compounds \u2014 testosterone \u2014is known to be released in greater quantities during intercourse. \u00a0As such, there is also a release of androgens with the anticipation of sex - causing those who sport facial hair to have it grow leading up to the act of copulation. \u00a0You can read more about interesting man facts\u00a0 here . \u00a0\n** Obviously waited a long time for some action **\ntagged\nEarlier today I stumbled (by way of Riss and by @ weareyourfek ) on a Village Voice blog post ( Shots  Fired: New York Times Columnists Andrew Ross Sorkin and Paul Krugman's Beef  Officially Cooked ) which dissects a recent (and now ongoing) beef between New York Times staffers Andrew Ross Sorkin and Paul Krugman ... the topic was nationalization of our banks... *yawn* we don't dive into politics as a priority at B-a-B (that's why Riss and I get along so well), but we wanted to throw our hat into the debate.\nThe post goes on to describe the many and various shots fired from each camp, the supporting articles, countering experts, and a bunch of other financial and journalistic yadda yadda yadda jargon... for us though, the question is not whether Andrew mischaracterized Dr. Doom's (NYU's Nouriel Roubini) words, nor is it about what's the right move for the economy (though everyone should read: Hairy economy trend: Beards are back )... the question is simple:\nBEARD, or NO BEARD\nGO BEARD, or GO HOME\nWe don't need to read articles upon articles, tap experts, talk about finance, examine global economy or even understand the Swede model for bank nationalization, to figure out at the end that Krugman is in the right (sorry for the spoiler)... Not only is he the bearded party in this spat, but he's a Nobel (another beardo FYI... though Karl Marx was too...) prize-winning economist for crying out loud!\ntagged\nEvery car in America needs a Carstache \u2122 - a $39.00 mustache you can proudly put on your car as you pick up chicks, dudes, groceries, and respect. \u00a0The makers of Carstache created this hairy hood ornament \"purely because we think it\u2019s funny. No other reason. It\u2019s unexpected and it makes people smile.\" \u00a0Naturally, B-a-B cannot help, but love it as well.\u00a0\nWe love it so much in fact that we'd like to interview the founders... so get in touch with us! To all the\u00a0Carstache owners out there, don't forget you can submit photos of your glorious automotive 'staches HERE . \u00a0 Thanks so much to Whitney for bring this to our attention. \u00a0\nDid you know that those who rock beards in\u00a0traditional media and the blogosphere write better than their shaved colleagues? \u00a0It is true. \u00a0Why?\u00a0 Simple put: beards are awesome and they impact every part of a person's life in a positive fashion.\u00a0 Beards - by nature - push expressionism, they give those experiencing writer's block \u00a0something to touch that helps them breakthrough to\u00a0their next genius point, and beards can be used as a distraction - to get the hard hitting questions answered as the interviewee becomes memorized by the facial fuzz of the reporter.\u00a0\nI stumbled upon this post by\u00a0 ZDNet \u00a0(written in\u00a0March 2010) and was completely impressed by how many people on their staff #proveit --\nAround the frenzy of Beard  Ball Brooklyn, we got a request from a lovely reporter/blogger/beard lover April Peveteaux for an interview for a possible feature in New York Magazine (which is one of Riss' life goals, FYI)... alas, the stars didn't align and B-a-B was cut out of the hairy coverage... no matter, what was NYMag's loss, was our gain. April and B-a-B founders have been friends ever since, and she even graced our presence at the Beard  Ball Brooklyn (see below, surrounded by beardos... one of them being her hubby):\nApril's genuine love for beards cannot be denied (even by her own words in a recent post titled 5 Things About My Love  Life , loving a man with a beard is on the list)... So, it goes without saying that when April tells us to jump, we ask how high... And ask us to jump she did... this time for a blog group she's writing for called The Stir .\nLast week April sat Riss and I down for an interview about the beards from below, that is to say Manscaping... What resulted was an introspective look at the hairy theme, with our 'expertise' at the forefront... thank you for everyone who helped us with the post, your thoughts and points were well noted, and in some cases even used!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAs promised, the second installment of our interview with Adam Lisagor \u00a0has posted for your bearded enjoyment....\nQ: Do a lot of your friends have beards?\u00a0 How does corporate culture impact your bearded decision (or not)?\nNot many of my friends have beards, actually. And that may be for many reasons: their careers may preclude the option, their personal style may conflict with the ruggedness of a beard, but I think most often it's just that their sissy faces can't really support the follicular activity. Every time I have the beard conversation with a friend, it's always, \"Oh, I can grow hair here and here, but it never comes in here.\" And all I can feel is sad for them, the way my friends felt sad for me when I was 15 and hadn't yet sprouted in my crotch or armpits.\nI'm self-employed, and even if I weren't, I work in an industry that favors those who look like shit at all times ( the sitting-in-front-of-a-computer industry ). So I have no impetus to ditch it for the furthering of my career. I read once that as a CEO, H. Ross Perot actually forbade the wearing of beards among his male employees, which just strikes me as pure fascist bullshit and I'm glad he lost the election because I'M KEEPIN MY BEARD, H. ROSS.\nAlso, at 32, I've sort of settled into my level of stockiness and girth. I wouldn't like to see what my bare cheeks look like at my current BMI. This is always a consideration for any bearded man.\nQ: What beard - throughout history - has inspired you?\u00a0 Do you have a bearded hero?\nI've always admired Stanley Kubrick's beard , because he always looked like he cared just enough to get dressed and trim his beard to avoid overgrowth, but that he had enough on his mind to keep him from caring too much. And I think our growth pattern is very similar, even on the head part of the beard, which I guess, is just called hair.\nMy other bearded hero is this guy , and I don't know his name. The \"show me you're nuts\" guy from \" Kentucky Fried Movie \" (1977). It's the way guys in the 70s used to wear a beard\u2014just classy.\nQ: How do you feel about the current beard trend?\u00a0 Is this good for the movement? Do you feel there might be backlash?\nHow do I feel about the current beard trend? It's fine, I guess. If all the beards went away tomorrow, I'd feel better about having mine. It never feels good to look like everybody else out there. I get so dismayed when I go to a party, or am out in public in a major city like LA, where I live, or Portland, where I go often, and see so many dudes that look just like me. It comes down to Freud's narcissism of small differences , where the more they look like me, the more reasons I have to find to distinguish myself from them and hate them. Like, \"Oh, that guy? His beard and glasses make him look so Jewy. Jew Jew Jew Jew JEWY JEW. [Note: I'm clearly Jewish, but there is no greater compliment to pay to a Jew than to tell him he doesn't look Jewish.]\" Sameness breeds a lot of hatred in counterculture. No one wants that. So I'd be fine if the trend took its leave.\nQ: Did you attend SXSWi?\u00a0 What did you think about the amount of beards that were there?\nI was there for Interactive , but honestly, I didn't notice. Again, I live in LA where beards abound, so there was nothing out of the ordinary about Austin during SXSW .\nAnything you'd like to tell us/share/link to?\nToday on putthison.com , the men's style show I do with my partner Jesse Thorn, Jesse did a post about facial hair options which I found pretty good. Someone wrote in to ask us about facial hair and Jesse fielded the question (since I don't really contribute to the blog, but Jesse does an amazing job), basically instructing the dude to avoid goatees at all cost, which is a solid piece of advice, for sure.\nI guess I've never asked my girlfriend of seven years, Roxana, how she feels about my beard, or whether she'd prefer me clean-shaven. I know for sure that it's better to be either clean-shaven or have a longer beard because a short beard or stubble is just irritating to the face of the person with whom you're necking, so that's a consideration. But she has a good sense of style, as the editor of the men's style site Nerd Boyfriend , and I trust that she'd tell me if I looked like a doofus.\nSometimes B-a-B\u00a0receives\u00a0killer tips from fans who scout beards on our behalf. \u00a0We were beyond thrilled when a loyal reader introduced us to Adam Lisagor who runs (or writes at) numerous blogs , but is best known for lonelysandwich . \u00a0Adam is a resident of Los Angeles and is keeping the city legit by rocking some killer face fur . \u00a0He was gracious enough to send B-a-B some interesting facts and FAQs of him and due to the absolute awesomeness of his answers (spanning from Stanley Kubrick's beard, his thoughts on H. Ross Perot, why chin-pads suck, to Freud's\u00a0narcissism of small differences),\u00a0this is going to be a\u00a0 special two-part interview. \u00a0\nOne thing is for certain - Adam is serious about his beard. \u00a0Luckily, B-a-B is a firm believer that good things come to obsessive-compulsives who fixate.\u00a0Adam feels that \"beards are certainly in fashion, and there aren't any signs of that momentum slowing.\"\u00a0 Here's a blog post he wrote \u00a0about his beard a couple years back, in response to a TIME article about their growing popularity.\nBelow are a few topics that B-a-B was privileged to talk to Adam about.... \u00a0\nPart I\u00a0\nBackground (via Adam)\nIn its current full-breaded state, my beard has been living with me since 2003. I had a girlfriend during college that was always encouraging me to grow a beard, and I'd experimented with facial hair configurations from the time I could get a patch of hair to coagulate on any spot of my face, but a beard always seemed too manly and, for lack of a better term, too\u00a0dad\u00a0for me. And I'm one of those adult males who was emotionally 17 for some time into his 20s, and then 23 until about the age of 30. So a beard was out of the question, at least until I was paying all of my own rent.\nThe\u00a0Experiment,\u00a0Gilligan, & Jim Jarmusch\nMy first experiment with facial hair was a small tuft on the point of my chin. A\u00a0Maynard G. Krebs, as I've always called it, after\u00a0 Gilligan's beatnik character \u00a0from\u00a0The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis. Mind you, this wasn't a chin-pad, which is, was and always will be a mortal sin in the world of facial hair. This was a small patch which signified the wearer as a member of the counterculture in the 90s, when I wore it in my first year of college. I'd been a jazzbo, and the look suited me. A huge fan of Jim Jarmusch and his prematurely gray hair, I even attempted to dye mine gray at one point but I did it wrong and it hurt my face.\nSideburns\u00a0Central, Luke Perry, & Training To Go Beard\nNext came sideburns. Real\u00a0 Luke Perry \u00a0specials. Something every young man should try once, and certainly better than the other extreme, which is whitewalls, which is the anti-beard, and great if you want to look like you're most at home at a petting zoo or a Civil War museum. During and particularly after college, I smoked a lot of weed,\u00a0 so\u00a0of course\u00a0I grew pork chops .\u00a0Pork chops are training ground for a full beard. And in 2001, beards weren't the rage as they are now. So I had to ease the world into my hairy face, or vice versa. The world had to ease me into my hairy face. Just look at the size of that J!\nThe Dude\u00a0\nAnyhow, as soon as I grew out of my unemployed post-college phase and joined the working world, it was time to try a beard out. And it worked for me. In the 80s, my dad always had a beard, and he looked pretty good.\u00a0 As an adult, I look a lot like my dad , so I sort of think of him in the 80s whenever I see myself bearded. Now, he's done more of a van dyke (which I'm not a huge fan of unless you're The Dude ) but it can look not bad on a distinguished older man.\u00a0 Here's me, bearded, and my dad, van dyked .\nRemembering Your Face\nEvery so often towards the beginning of my beard tenure, I'd have to shave it off to remember what my face looked like. See\u00a0 this picture \u00a0for what my face looks like. But I hate to shave. I hate it. Even in a hot shower, it'd bug the shit out of me, so I'd just stop shaving. And I think that's where the beard mostly came from\u2014laziness. So in addition to signifying membership in a counterculture, it signifies laziness, which is most often part and parcel.\nAvoid Enhancing Fleshiness\nBy now, at 32, I've gone at least 3 or 4 years without having done more than close-crop the beard, and I don't think I will shave it any time soon. My normal grooming regimen is about every two weeks, I'll pull out the Wahl and give it the once over with a #3 guard, and then a #2 and then clean up the neck area. But most important, MOST IMPORTANT, is to go gradually into a bare neck. Don't, under any circumstance, make a sharp edge at the bottom of your beard and leave that whole patch of under-jaw bare. Because it will enhance the fleshiness of your skin and make you look like a dork. In grade school, I'd always get A's on map making by feathering the borders of the land and the water. I apply this philosophy to my beard trimming and it hasn't failed me. Oh, and no chin-straps, fellas. No way, Jebediah.\nThe Signature Beard & Shooting Lasers\nAnd my beard has, by this point, become my signature. My face is pretty easily maleable, and I have no problem changing my look, so I'm quite sure that many people wouldn't recognize me if I were to lose the beard. Likewise, my thick plastic frames. At some point, I'll get laser eye surgery (so I can shoot lasers from my eyes) and I'll no longer need glasses. But I'm quite sure that I'll still wear non-prescription frames because I like frames and they're sort of my trademark. To an obnoxious point, actually. I get a lot of \"Oh, here's a picture of a guy that looks just like you!\" and it'll just be some schlub with a beard and glasses, but an entirely dissimilar face. I'll make it clear here and now: knock that shit off, people. We are actual human beings under our beards and glasses, unique like snowflakes and unlike that analogy.\n(Stay tuned for Part II....)\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLast week, B-a-B\u00a0blogged\u00a0about the trend of\u00a0 post break-up\u00a0beardos \u00a0(aka: those that grew a beard after being dumped as a final f-you act or those that grew a beard after breaking some partner's heart). \u00a0We put a call to action - we wanted to interview someone who fit this description - and the extremely talented\u00a0 Max Dana \u00a0answered the call. \u00a0\nMax runs the popular blog ' Dissentertainer ' -\u00a0dedicated to uncovering the hidden treasures of music, film, art and the culture at large. \u00a0More importantly, he sports one fine looking beard after experiencing some heartache (Note: I've known Max for years - and it's completely the girl's loss - he's a New York City\u00a0 gem ).\u00a0\nRecently, we sat down over beers and discussed Max's hairy tale.... when his beard \"became a man,\" the experience of growing an epic Civil War-style beard, how beards are \"catnip for girls,\" and\u00a0how Max balances both his mod & lumberjack facial hair\u00a0styling....\nBAB: How long were you dating and why did you choose to grow a beard after the relationship ended?\u00a0\u00a0\nMax:\u00a0We dated for about a year, but I didn't give birth to the beard until a few months after we broke up. It was actually more of an \"accidental beard\" and didn't initially have anything to do with my ex, but I don't love it any less for being unplanned or conceived out of wedlock.\u00a0\nBAB: Did the post break-up beard start as a mustache and grow into a beard - or did you decide to go all out?\u00a0 Was it a conscious decision?\u00a0\nMax:\u00a0I grew the beard as a form of self-defense. At first it was just some light scruff that I was sporting after a particularly lazy Labor Day weekend. I was a few weeks away from my 30th birthday and facial hair seemed like a really grown-up thing that I had never tried, so I decided not to shave for the rest of the month.\u00a0\u00a0\nA few days into the experiment, I let the ex-girlfriend in question take a shower at my apartment while I was at work because she had been sleeping at her office and needed to clean herself up before visiting apartments that night. I told her to be gone by the time I got home and to leave her set of keys behind, but of course she was there upon my return. \u00a0Further, when I got back to the apt, she didn't want to leave. When I insisted that she leave she got a little crazy and a little violent (note to self: don't leave box cutters around the house), so I decided to take an evening stroll to the local police precinct.\nShe was gone by the time I got back, but the next morning I noticed that my underwear felt a little breezier than normal and discovered a gaping hole that had been slashed in the crotch. She had apparently used my time at the precinct - to not only cut up most of my clothes - but also to fold and hang them up perfectly so I would discover a little bit more of her \"crazy\" each and every morning.\u00a0\u00a0That was the day my beard became a man.\u00a0 I abandoned my plan to shave it and decided to wear it as a disguise instead.\nBAB: Did your ex see you with\u00a0a beard\u00a0weeks or years later\u00a0- did she have any comments (good or bad)?\nMax:\u00a0She may have seen a photo online because she was\u00a0cyber stalking\u00a0me for a good three months after that, but she never saw it in person. I'm sure she would have hated it because she would have understood the meaning behind it.\u00a0It wasn't until I grew the beard that I also grew the balls to finally change my\u00a0phone\u00a0number and excommunicate her permanently from my consciousness.\u00a0\u00a0\nBAB: How long have you rocked a beard since this relationship ended?\u00a0\nMax: I kept it for about a year, but eventually had to shave it off for a show. It's hard to maintain a consistent beard as an actor unless you have branded yourself as a\u00a0beardo, but once in a while you get to really go for it. Last year I grew out an epic Civil War-style beard for a show based on a Faulkner novel. I felt like I got to know my beard in a new light.\u00a0\nBAB: Will you keep growing it?\u00a0 Why?\nMax: My mod side and my lumberjack side are still fighting this one out, but shaving is a pain in the ass. \u00a0Besides, beards are catnip for girls so I don't see myself going clean anytime soon.\nBAB: What does your beard mean to you?\nMax:\u00a0My father sported a super manly beard when I was a kid, but shaved it off recently, so my beard sometimes feels like the passing of the torch. It makes me want to learn how to restore muscle cars and hunt with a bow and arrow.\nMax the Beardo\nDapper Days (and proof point on why beards are catnip to us ladies - meow...)\nClean faced Max (prior to the break-up)\n\u00a0\n"

To be honest, this also describes my relationship with most friends and family.\nAnyway, another packed load of news this week, including not one but two mildly appalling photographs to look at. And since a picture is worth a thousand words, I must only have a couple more sentences left to type.\nITEM! We don't often cover EastEnders and its soapy brethren, but every so often, a soap news story comes up that is so exciting, so meaningful, so downright hilarious, I have to give it a few words. Earlier in the week, Digital Spy unveiled a first look at Ian Beale's return to Albert Square as a tramp, after he managed to balls up yet another marriage. Because, I guess, he's been there since the very beginning, and what storylines are really left? Alien abduction next year?\nIn case you missed it, here's a preview. Note the beard, which must have taken actor Adam Woodyatt forever to grow, and is probably still better than his 90s moustache .\nITEM! Moving on to better TV (hard work but think I've managed it), AMC have unveiled a new trailer for the upcoming fifth season of Breaking Bad. I love this show, for reasons I've already outlined on this site , so it's exciting to see Walt and Jesse in action again, but also bittersweet because it's the last season.\nExcept not really, because they're slicing the \"fifth\" season into two eight episode chunks separated by a year, so the second may as well be a sixth season. ANYWAY. Here is the trailer.\nITEM! In last week's groundbreaking first column , I linked to the latest episode of Richard Herring's Leicester Square Theatre Podcast, and I'm going to do it again, because this week has Graham Linehan (creator of Father Ted and The IT Crowd) and Armando Iannucci OBE (creator of The Thick Of It, Veep, others), which is a pretty hot line-up. So head over here to check it out .\nIannucci has gotten other play in the news this week, both for his new HBO series Veep starting on Sky Atlantic and after a junior minister's verbal dismemberment by Jeremy Paxman was observed to resemble a scene from his The Thick Of It, which is all the excuse I need to embed the relevant scene.\nITEM! And staying with Mr Iannucci (of OBE fame), a press release has been issued about his long awaited Alan Partridge film and its release in August 2013, in partnership with French filmmakers StudioCanal. Yes, maybe it is a movie, but Partridge comes from TV and the release features some great quotes from the man himself, so I've worked them in:\n\"I\u0092m simultaneously gladdened and pleased to see a British film being co-funded by the French dudes at Studiocanal. This is without doubt the greatest Anglo-French co-operation since the Normandy landings. This time, the heroes aren\u0092t Allied servicemen \u0096 they\u0092re motion picture financiers, who are equally brave.\"\n\"I\u0092d also like to add that \u0091canal\u0092 \u0096 or, in English, \u0091canal\u0092 \u0096 is a transportation system close to my heart. In the late 18th century, this new method of logistics halved the price of coal in many English cities. If Studiocanal\u0092s investment can achieve even a fraction of that, I will be delighted.\"\nITEM! Last, and.... very possibly least, a photo has been released from the upcoming US version of The Inbetweeners, featuring the all-new all-American incarnations of our constantly masturbating heroes. This show comes to us from MTV, and we can only hope it is as successful as their US launch of Skins. How much will they change? Does \"briefcase wanker\" translate to \"document-wallet douchebag\" over there? We can only wait and see.\nBut for now, here it is, resembling a glimpse into a horrifying parallel universe.\nEpisode Review\n21:24 on 4th May 2017\nAdvertisement\n"

This devilish style swept through the   male chin world of the 1990s and, despite making people look a little like   the devil, can still be seen on many chins today. The goatee was equally at   home on the band member of a Grunge band (90\u2019s icon Kurt Cobain ) as it was   on the lead singer of a Jazz Funk band (remember Jamiroquai and the Godzilla music video?). It was named the goatee because of it\u2019s   similarity to a Billy goat beard and was the perfect way to wear a beard   without looking like your dad.\nFor successful attempts at goatees then check out 1990\u2019s Brad Pitt or   Johnny Depp. Or, as I mentioned previously \u2013 the Devil. For less coveted   versions think Colonel Sanders, Lenin or my high school friend Dan who,   after his failed attempt at growing a goatee, was never again called \"Dan\" in his high school career.

Moustache\nI started growing a moustache in October.\u00a0 Aside from an unfortunate phase in the 90s when I experimented with a goatee, I've never ventured into the world of facial hair.\u00a0 The moustache has been unexpectedly rewarding.\u00a0 I'm used to very long, drawn-out processes like sculpture, where short-term gratification does not exist.\u00a0 Even pottery requires two firings and glazing decisions (ie. weeks) before a finished object appears.\nI found myself delighted by the various phases of the moustache in relatively little time.\u00a0 Its appearance changed nearly every day.\u00a0 There was the trim cop-moustache phase for a week.\u00a0 The old Hollywood phase and then lately the handlebar.\u00a0 The handlebar to me was always the destination so now it's a matter of focusing on the variations of the end curls.\u00a0 Throughout the month of November multiple people asked if I grew the moustache for Movember (the campaign to raise awareness for prostate and testicular cancer).\u00a0 I didn't know about Movember at first, but I was pleased that my moustache development coincided with it.\nClassic men's grooming has always fascinated me, not least because of of my interest in smells.\u00a0 My mother always kept a can of Pinaud's talcum on her hairdressing station.\u00a0 When I lived in London I would regularly lurk around Jermyn Street inspecting combs and badger shave brushes while sniffing Bay Rum at Geo F Trumper.\u00a0\nOf course I was excited to experiment with moustache waxes as my upper lip required grooming.\u00a0 I started with Pinaud Clubman wax because it's the easiest to find, is the least expensive and comes with a moustache brush/comb.\u00a0 The results were disappointing.\u00a0 The hold was unreliable (although, admittedly there was not much moustache to hold at the time). The white flakes of dried wax that resembled dandruff led to my decision to hold off on the Clubman.\u00a0 Shame, particularly because the scent is excellent, like Earl Gray Tea.\nI started using Ungarische Bartwichse from Marke Golddachs.\u00a0 It's apparently the wax Salvador Dali used to create his impossible hirsute surrealism. The scent is pleasant, a peppery beeswax with a vanilla creaminess, reminding me of a fragrance I wear, Poivre 23 by Le Labo.\u00a0 The substance itself is less stiff than the Clubman allowing easier application and molding.\nI recently acquired a tin of the Firehouse Moustache Wax.\u00a0 Its stiffness allows an excellent hold and I found that it's best used on the twirly bits at the end.\u00a0 The scent is a very subtle beeswax.\u00a0 It's, perhaps the perfect moustache wax for my needs.\nPosted by\n"

We are body, soul and spirit. The body is just a casing (or an earthsuit as John Eldredge likes to say) to give our real selves something to walk around in during our brief stay on this planet.\nAnd yet we judge each other so harshly based on our physical appearance.\nBut I delve in far too deep for an entry that is really far more light-hearted\u2026\nFor nearly fifteen years I wore a mustache and beard (a goatee as it were) on my face.\nMy wife liked it. I believe she said it \u201cmade me look devilish\u201d\u2026 proof that women DO like a little \u201cbad boy\u201d in their man. \uf609\nWhen I became a known quantity in the Internet marketing space, the goatee was a trademark. People instantly recognized me because of the trendy facial hair.\nOne night while I was sleeping, it happened\u2026\nI woke up the next morning, and my goatee and mustache were GONE!\nBefore\u2026\n\u2026 and after\nI can\u2019t say for sure what strange phenomenon occurred, but I\u2019ve been without facial hair ever since.\nI can only speculate as to the nature of this mystery, but I suspect that my goatee is probably off somewhere writing a tell-all ebook about living on my face for those many years.\nIt wouldn\u2019t surprise me if it registered a domain like JoelsGoateeSecrets.com and was planning a big product launch for sometime in the future.\nIt\u2019s fine. If the goatee ever spills more than it should, I have enough dirt on it to scare it back into the five-o-click shadows.\nNevertheless, since I lost the goatee it has been very interesting to watch people interact with me.\nSome do double-takes. Others allude to there being something different about me but they just can\u2019t put their finger on it.\nBut there are three statements I hear more than any others.\n1) I look thinner.\n2) I look younger.\nThank you. I\u2019m not any younger. But I appreciate the compliment.\n3) I look more trustworthy.\nI didn\u2019t think I looked UNtrustworthy to begin with! But I assure you that my moral barometer has not adjusted one way or the other due to the absence of facial hair.\nAnd that begs that question.\nWill the goatee and mustache ever return?\nNot likely.\nThe Mrs. has decided that she likes the change. And I must confess, I\u2019m pretty happy without it as well.\nOh, and in conclusion, I\u2019ve got a special note for my goatee, whereever it may be\u2026\nYour days are over, my furry friend. Best to put the past behind you. It was a fond fifteen years. Farewell.\nJoel,\nI have to agree with your wife. There is something more vulnerable about no facial hair. Facial hair does tend to me intimidating and you do look younger and more approachable. Love the article. Thanks!\nEleni Liapakis\nGoatee or not goatee!\nThat is the question!\nI think it doesn\u2019t matter how old or young you are, if you can pull it off, you can pull it off. It\u2019s all about tweaking the length and width and even colors.\nI can see it now\u2026\u2026\u2026\nYou too can get Joel Comm\u2019s Goatee Secrets 1.0 book, a $9.95 value, absolutely free, just pay shipping and handling.\nBut wait, there\u2019s more!\nAct now and you get a free copy of iGoatee for your iPhone, where you can take a picture of you, your friends, your mom, or even the dog, and put several different styles and colors of goatee\u2019s on them. Send them to your grandparents (to give them a heart attack and speed up the inheritance), publish them around the office (everybody loves a good joke right?), or even send one of your behind with a goatee on it to your boss to let him know just how much you enjoyed working for him those past 19 years (thanking him for firing you a year before you would\u2019ve collected a full pension).\nROFLMAO!\nJoel,\nWell, you DO look younger and thinner. I always chuckle at the folks who think people with facial hair are untrustworthy. Loved the old look and love the new look. Thanks for the chuckle this morning.\nJonathan October 14, 2009 at 8:25 pm Reply\nHah! Your brand authenticity is a winner with or without the goatee Joel \u2026 no contest.\nAll the best\nHi,\nIt\u2019s a fun post, for sure. I was just wondering how some not-so-significant things have a real importance in minds of people when they are forming first impressions. Your post makes me even the more curious?\nBut trust can\u2019t be hidden in facial hair for sure!!! LOL!\nWeb October 22, 2009 at 5:59 pm Reply\nYes you look much younger without it and wealthier looking. But, with shaved no one will believe the yahoo games avatar. Haa.\nTake care Joel.\nCraig October 29, 2009 at 7:11 pm Reply\nGoatees are so old school, 90\u2019s, think I\u2019m cool but not, hockey player, hide my smallish chin anyway\u2026so good move. Nobody needs to be wearing a goatee anymore.\n1kadayblogspot November 19, 2009 at 3:13 am Reply\nYes I agree that physical appearance adds value to your performace ethics but still at the same time we are aware that this competitive world where all have to work hard to get things. make money online\nAll I can say is that you look a little less like me now.\nWhen I attended my first event (JV Alert Live Philly, June \u201908), I had attendees comment on how much I look like you (since I am about seven years younger).\nHowever, I am still your younger, fatter, grayer twin.\nLooking forward to finally meeting you next month here in Philly at the next JV Alert Live.\nGuess I\u2019ll have to shave (clean) so we can take some quality pictures together.\nBest to you!\nLeave a Reply\n\uf31f\uf449\uf3fc The Fun Socks I got for My Birthday & What Happened with My iPhone Problem! \u2600\ufe0f\uf435 #JoelLive #GoLive https://t.co/iU3YXFYXFI 6hours ago\nRecent Posts\n"

If you are planning on     getting your 90\u2019s on hair-wise, that is, this is the place for you.\u00a0 We start with the ubiquitous Rachel do which you couldn\u2019t get away     from (and, really, who would want to \u2013 it was so damn cute).\u00a0 But, we don\u2019t stop there.\u00a0 We explore the ins and outs of 90s     facial hair fashions and more.\u00a0 Read on.\nLet us know what kind of hair you had in the 90s     (and better yet, send pics!) by posting it on our 90s 411 Facebook page.\u00a0 The burning questions need answers \u2013 like, who had better hair:     George Clooney or Dawson?\n\"So I want it kind of rough and ready but like     really shiny and smooth and kind of chin length but shoulder lengthy     and like straight but a bit curly and a sort of golden brown but a     bit blonde. Wait a minute let me get my People Magazine out!\"\nThat was the conversation held in thousands of hair salons in the     mid-90s as women everywhere tried to describe the \"Rachel Cut\" named     after and inspired by the character played by Jennifer Aniston in     the sitcom Friends which was then at the peak of its     popularity. This definitive 90\u2019s hairstyle was a shoulder-length,     sleek and layered style with a grown out fringe and highlights     mainly around the face. It was the most popular hair fashion fad of     the 90\u2019s and the envy of all women. It also inspired many a \"just     got out of bed\" hair product, for example one of the originals Tigi Bed Head.\n\u00a0\nBoys had their own trends to follow. For the daring fashion crowd there   were hair styles with zig zags and Nike ticks shaved into them and inspired   by Hip Hop artists and big bleached hair inspired, not by the previous   decade\u2019s Wham but by the \" pretty fly for a white guy \" MC Hammer wannabe Vanilla Ice . Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?\nFor the everyday boy on the street the look was floppy and dreamy like   Dawson of Dawson\u2019s Creek , Joey of Friends , Edward Furlong   pre voice breaking in Terminator 2 and Keanu Reeves of\u2026. well   practically every 90s movie going! This was the look for anyone wanting to   attract a girlfriend rather than make a nineties fashion statement. The kind   of hair that made you just ache to lean over and gently move it out of their   adorable eyes just before they told you they loved you, gave you a slow   sloppy kiss and recited a bit of poetry!\nOne look for men which was executed with style by some and in the worst   way possible by others was the goatee. This devilish style swept through the   male chin world of the 1990s and, despite making people look a little like   the devil, can still be seen on many chins today. The goatee was equally at   home on the band member of a Grunge band (90\u2019s icon Kurt Cobain ) as it was   on the lead singer of a Jazz Funk band (remember Jamiroquai and the Godzilla music video?). It was named the goatee because of it\u2019s   similarity to a Billy goat beard and was the perfect way to wear a beard   without looking like your dad.\nFor successful attempts at goatees then check out 1990\u2019s Brad Pitt or   Johnny Depp. Or, as I mentioned previously \u2013 the Devil. For less coveted   versions think Colonel Sanders, Lenin or my high school friend Dan who,   after his failed attempt at growing a goatee, was never again called \"Dan\" in his high school career. Due to the unfortunate coarse curly hair which   made up his goatee he was forever more called \"Pubic Hair Chin!\"\nAnother popular hair trend for men in the 90\u2019s was the long, thick   sideburn. Perhaps this burn lengthening was wrapped up in the 70s revival in   the fashion world. Whatever the impetus, burns got longer and thicker and   were (I\u2019ll admit it) a weakness of mine. Think Chris Isaak in the very sexy Wicked Game era or Jason Priestly of 90210 .\nIn case you are interested, Dan (my goatee-growing friend from high   school) eventually got rid of the goatee. But, I haven\u2019t learned my lesson   yet and still have a twice yearly disastrous attempt at going classic 90\u2019s Baywatch blonde.\nFor more on 90\u2019s hair accessories, see our stories on Scrunchies and Butterfly   Hair Clips.\nComment\nName *\nEmail *\nWebsite\nCatch up on all the current 90s News and Events\n"

But if you have noticed, facial hair - from carefully cultivated stubble to thick, stylised beards - has been in fashion for at least five years now. Even cricketers have caught on. The Indian players are virtually indistinguishable from each other, Kane Williamson has the ability to grow a neck beard, and David Warner has a respectable looking 'tache, possibly to give him a more serious-minded look.\nThose are all good tries, but the '70s remain the sexiest decade for facial hair in cricket, ammirright? Granted, there are no beards in this photo of the Australian squad from 1975, but look at the droops and the 'burns.\n\u00a9Getty Images\nBut before they preen too much, let's dial back a hundred years or so and admire the efforts of this set of Australian gents. Wonder if the artist took the liberty to add volume to some of those beards, though.\nCould any other 'mo hold a candle to former Australian batsman Syd Gregory 's? Probably just as well, given the amount of wax that must have gone into getting it to hold that shape.\nYou need to work harder, son.\nMerv Hughes gets all up in David Boon 's business. What's the social protocol around touching another human being's hairy upper lip?\nSometimes less is more, as Ajit Wadekar announces on arrival in England in 1971, when India went on to win their first series in the country.\n\u00a9PA Photos\nFormer England wicketkeeper Godfrey Evans was the inspiration behind the Wolverine look.\nAnd I'm just going to say what everyone else is thinking: Ricky Ponting 's early 1990s goatee was obviously the inspiration behind Kevin Richardson's Backstreet Boys look . Though '90s-era Ponting was more AJ than Kevin in vibe.\nSpeaking of musicians, can someone tell Justin Timberlake that this is how you bring sexy back? I mean, Andy Roberts (left) isn't even trying and he's got you by your soul. And Viv, as if he needed any facial hair to accentuate that jawline.\nRecognise this fella? Usually the cummerbund is pressed into doing far more work. WG Grace with the beard, minus the belly.\nA beard nearly as famous as Grace's is Hashim Amla 's. And as you can see, with proper care, you can make it do your work for you.\nThese Australians will go to any lengths with their mind games. Doug Bollinger tries imitating a scarecrow with fungal growth to get a wicket.\nA number of Pakistani players in recent years have sported luxuriant beards - Saeed Anwar, Saqlain Mushtaq, Mushtaq Ahmed and even Inzamam-ul-Haq. But Misbah-ul-Haq 's is possibly the most stylish. Clean-shaven Misbah looks like a PTA dad. Bearded Misbah looks like a PTA dad who will sing a self-composed song at karaoke nights (about the pain of not quite getting to the fastest Test hundred record) and make you his special artisanal tea blend for when you need to calm down after a round of meetings with the PCB.\nLet's wrap it up by acknowledging the efforts of the young brigade. Australians Kane Richardson (left) and Andrew Tye prompt us to pose the eternal question: is your face half-full or half-empty of hair?\nNishi Narayanan is an assistant editor at ESPNcricinfo\n\u00a9 ESPN Sports Media Ltd.\n"

How many times have you seen a boy you thought was just alright grow a beard, then immediately assume the position? Check.\nI realized a had a beard fetish when I came home one night on my birthday, and my roommate bought be a shower curtain covered in various types of beards, with the proper name of each style, and said \u201cYou\u2019re welcome beard lady.\u201d I say \u00a0I have a \u201ctype,\u201d yet she says \u201cproblem.\u201d Tomato/tomato.\nLet\u2019s talk beards, shall we?

And I\u2019m sure Pandora\u2019s boxxxxxx just might agree.\nThen there is the goatee. Super cool. If you refuse to let go of the 90\u2019s.\nThen there is this beauty. Now, I loved Anchorman, but I don\u2019t want to \u201clove\u201d Anchorman. Sorry Ron Burgundy. That would tickle. Stay classy.\nThen there is the 5 o\u2019clock shadow. Kinda hot. But looks like a fear of commitment. Looks great on Willam though!\nThen there is this. I could raise kids on a mountain with this one. Maybe admire his log. Cause he probably is into logging. You know, like trees. What were you guys thinking? Dirty birds.\nNow this is the next level. I think I just peed a little. Probably out of fear.\nNope, sorry. Try again.\nNope, sorry. This guy is probably a super cool dude though. Probably really good at darts too.\nI don\u2019t think this is an actually style of beard, just a very tan, very retired wrestler.\nThe fuck??
